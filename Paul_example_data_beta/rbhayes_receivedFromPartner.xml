		<provenance>this pipe bag is unique because the fringe on the bottom has been twisted into a braid to make it look like a tobacco braid. The top part has been rubbed with yellow ochre. The Cheyenne were fond of doing this type of thing according to Brian Jensen, a private collector. The bead work is typical Sioux, so Brian believes that whoever made this piece has some Cheyenne heritage.</provenance>

		<provenance>Presented to Brigadier General Eliakim B. Scammon, formerly a Colonel in the 23rd O.V.I., while serving on the plains soon after his graduation from West Point Military Academy in 1837.  Brian Jensen, a private collector and who called West Point and verified the graduation date, feels this pipe bag was made between 1870's and 1890's. If so, then General Scammon probably received this bag later in his service.
This bag is unique because a green beaded background was unusual.</provenance>

		<notes>The appraiser thought this might be an English Country Chippendale style chair. According to the Hayes Home guide notes, it is a cross of many styles. It has a Chippendale back yet flat on top with straight legs, some Dutch styling and a padded seat. The provenance is not known. It possibly could be the chair sent to Rutherford by his cousin Charlotte DeWitt in 1882. See "A" file for excerpt from letter dated September 4, 1882.</notes>

Mr. Barber, in a letter to RBH dated May 3, 1882, stated "she is the leading cow in a large 30/50 cattle piece of mine in the National Academy, N.Y." Mr. Barber also calls this portrait "a study from nature or rather from life."  Mr. Barber requested $50 for a copy. See "A" file for copies of letters dated June 5 and June 6, 1882.

		<notes>Born in 1786 near Petersburg, Virginia, Winfield Scott's father was a successful farmer who had served in the Revolutionary War. His mother came from a wealthy Virginia family. Though both his parents died when he was young, Scott's inheritance was m odest. He studied for a short time at William and Mary College before undertaking the study of law in Petersburg. He practiced law and served in the army in the period prior to the War of 1812. With the outbreak of the War of 1812, Scott recruited a regiment and was promoted to the rank of lieutenant colonel. He served on the northern front, and his bravery and energy brought him honors and promotion, as he was brevetted a major general. 
After the war, Scott studied European military methods, wrote on military and other subjects, and took up headquarters in New York City. He returned to active duty with the Black Hawk War in 1832, and was commissioned by President Andrew Jackson to pr oceed to South Carolina to watch over the nullification movement. Other military actions involved the controversial Seminole and Creek conflict in 1835, in which he clashed with Jackson, and a more celebrated role in restoring tranquility on the Canadian border during Martin Van Buren's presidency. Owing to his prominence as a military leader as well as a potential Whig presidential candidate, Scott was made general-in-chief of the army in 1841. 

It was the Mexican War that brought Scott lasting renown. He was ordered to Mexico in November 1846. Obstructed by poorly equipped troops, limited reinforcements and supplies, desertions, and disease, Scott nevertheless undertook a successful five-mo nth campaign from Vera Cruz to Mexico City. But feuds generated by ambitious subordinate officers and, especially, the hostility of the Polk administration to further honoring a Whig general, led to Scott's recall and replacement. In addition, a court of inquiry was established to investigate Sc ott's actions in disciplining those disloyal officers. The charges against Scott were eventually dropped, and Congress voted him its thanks and a gold medal. In 1852, Congress passed a measure offering Scott the pay, rank, and emoluments of a lieutenant general, the first person to hold that office since G eorge Washington. That same year, he was the Whig party's unsuccessful candidate for President. 

As the secession crisis developed during the latter part of 1860, Scott pleaded unsuccessfully to President James Buchanan to reinforce the southern forts and armories against possible seizure. He brought his headquarters from New York to Washington, D.C., so that he could oversee the recruiting and training of the capital's defence. He personally commanded Abraham Lincoln's bodyguard at the inauguration. Now seventy-five years old, Scott requested retirement, and in November 1861, he was retired. Five years later, he died at West Point and was buried i n the national cemetery there. 

A large and imposing figure, Scott as a young man stood six feet, five inches tall and weighed 230 pounds. His career was extraordinarily long, some fifty years, and he was the associate of every President from Thomas Jefferson to Lincoln. Called "Fuss and Feathers" because of his punctiliousness in dress and decorum, his reputation for patriotism and generosity generally won him the trust and loyalty of his troops.

		<notes>this sword stand is part of a sword collection given to (and later purchased by) President Hayes in 1879 by a distant cousin, R. T. Hayes, of Los Angeles. This cousin was seeking an appointment to serve in some capacity in Japan. See "A" file for documentation letters from both R. T. Hayes (dated June 1, July 31, and September 2, 1879) and President Hayes (dated August 21, 1879). In 1985, the museum staff removed the handles from the swords and made rubbings of the Japanese characters on the tangs. Pictures of these rubbings and the stand were sent to Mr. Gerald Alferes, an expert on Japanese language and swords. He feels this stand is of value but could not appraise it from the picture alone.

It was located near the Town House, and the interior of the trunk, after the tree had fallen, was found to contain a large number of iron nails, used probably to tack up notices in early times. This memento was given to me by the Hon. Eli Jones Henkle, from the 5th Congressional district of Maryland, and is in turn, presented to President Hayes.  Thos Lincoln Casey, Lt. Col., Corps of Engrs. May 31, 1879."</notes>

		<provenance>made by George C. Brown, carpenter and builder, from Baltimore, Maryland and presented to President and Lucy Hayes by the lady managers of a Methodist Church Fair, for their only daughter, Fanny (aged 11 years), on February 13, 1878. President and Lucy Hayes were in Baltimore on February 13, 1878, attending the opening of the Methodist Fair at the Masonic Temple, for the benefit of the Emery Grove Camp-meeting Association. This dollhouse is one two which Fanny and her younger brother, Scott, played with at the White House. The dollhouse was not intended as a model for any particular building. When Hayes left the White House in 1881, the dollhouse was taken to the Hayes residence in Spiegel Grove, Fremont, Ohio where it remained until the Hayes Library was built in 1914. In 1960 the miniature house was restored by Harold Robinson of Fremont, OH and was wired for electric lights by Richard L. Whitman of the Burkett Electric Shop, Fremont, OH. None of the few pieces of original furniture has been preserved. After restoration, the dollhouse was furnished with miniature antique furniture by Mrs. Webb C. Hayes, III of Chevy Chase, Maryland and Spiegel Grove, Fremont, OH.

		<notes>this sword, usually displayed on sword stand,  is part of a collection given to (and later purchased by) President Hayes in 1879 by a distant cousin, R. T. Hayes, of Los Angeles. This cousin was seeking an appointment to serve in some capacity in Japan. See "A" file for documentation letters from both R. T. Hayes (dated June 1, July 31, and September 2, 1879) and President Hayes (dated August 21, 1879). According to the documentation found in the "A" file it was made in in August of 1678.
In 1985, the museum staff removed the handles from the swords and made rubbings of the Japanese characters on the tangs. Pictures of these rubbings were sent to Mr. Gerald Alferes, an expert on Japanese language and swords. According to Gerald Alferes the fittings for this type of ceremonial sword are known as Efu No Maki Tachi. The sword was used for court wear. The mounting was definitely made later than the blade. The signature on the blade reads: "IGA [NO] (province) KAMI (lord of) FUJIWARA (honorary clan name) KINMICHI (craft name) NIHON (Japanese) KAJI (swordsmith) SOSHO (master) ENPO SECHI(1679) HACHI (8th) GOTU (moon) HI (day). There are 2 main (family) lines in this group of swordsmiths, 1 having 5 generations and the other 10 generations. This blade appears to be by the 3rd generation of the Yamashiro line.

In 1985, the museum staff removed the handles from the swords and made rubbings of the Japanese characters on the tangs. Pictures of these rubbings were sent to Mr. Gerald Alferes, an expert on Japanese language and swords. According To Mr. Alferes, the signature reads: "Goro Nyudo (retired Priest) Masamune (Craft Name) and the date 1864. Masamune was the most famous Japanese swordsmith ever and Alferes believes this signature is definitely a forgery. According to George Cameron Stone's "A Glossary of the Construction, Decoration and Use of Arms and Armour", page 444, if the Mekugi (peg) is made of double screws, which this one is, it is an indication of an old item.

Hayes, of Los Angeles. This cousin was seeking an appointment to serve in some capacity in Japan. See "A" file for documentation letters from both R. T. Hayes (dated June 1, July 31, and September 2, 1879) and President Hayes (dated August 21, 1879). See "A" file for letters, dated June 20 and October 18, 1985 and January 6, 1986.

Pictures of these rubbings were sent to Mr. Gerald Alferes, an expert on Japanese language and swords. A rubbing from the tang of this knife was sent. According to Mr. Alferes, this type of short sword was used in Kamakura times (pre 1350 A. D.), though many of this type were made much later for presentation purposes. This one has an interesting inscription: "KOMPIRA TSUGUSADA TSUNODA KONDO TAKEIYE IEDA MIZUTA " which means "for the shrine of Kompira (this shrine is located on Shikouga Island in Kagawa Province) made by Tsugusada (who was from the Shimosaka school). These people ordered items for the shrine for protection against sickness. This Ken is a Shinto period blade. The Shinto period is from 1596 to 1794 A.D. The swordsmith is listed in "Japanese Swordsmiths" by W. M. Hawley. Tsugusada is listed as working in the Echigen Province and later moved to Edo (Tokyo) and was active in 1681. So this blade does not date back to 860 A.D. as is listed in old documentation. See "A" file for letters, dated June 20 and October 18, 1985 and January 6, 1986.

		<notes>According to Russ Pritchard, MOLLUS, because of the size of this flag, the first part of this statement in the old records is questionable.  Normally a unit flag was smaller, making it more mobile - as Wise's Legion would be mobile.  Large flags such as this one were usually installation flags which were not moved around much (immobile due to size).  The extra stars could possibly represent the two "hopeful" states of Maryland and Delaware. </notes>

Astral lamps are distinguished by their small central circular reservoir for the fluid conveyed to the Argand burners; this reduced shadows. This lamp had a companion lamp (smaller) which was located in the Master Bedroom. It was broken and is now in the museum storage. See "A" file for damage report. Both lamps are thought to be original to home.

		<provenance>Mrs. Garfield gave this calendar to Ex-President R. B. Hayes as a memento of her dead husband, President James A. Garfield.

Custer's Antique's 1984 appraisal refers to "2 straight Windsor chairs."

Astral lamps are distinguished by their small central circular reservoir for the fluid conveyed to the Argand burners; this reduced shadows. This lamp has a companion lamp (larger) which is located in the front hall. This lamp was broken and is now in museum storage. See "A" file for damage report. Both lamps are thought to be original to home.

		<notes>See "A" file for correspondence with West Point, November, 2004. According to this correspondence, the Saratoga cannons were inscribed as trophies of war by skilled artisans serving with the Continental Army at West Point. According to Saratoga National Park members this was the only one of the surrender trophy cannons to be inscribed with the exact place of captured. </notes>

		<provenance>Cannon captured at Breymann Redoubt on October 7, 1777. Known as a Saratoga gun, Richard Gilpin cast this cannon in his foundry in London, England, in 1761. The crowned "L" on the barrel is the seal of the Master General of the Ordnance, John, 1st Earl of Ligonier. King George III's seal is the crown over the letters "GR." American forces captured it from the British during the Revolutionary War (1775-1783).  According to the inscription it was "Taken at the storm of the British lines near Saratoga October 7, 1777 by ____________."  The American commander Benedict Arnold's name was originally inscribed on the cannon, but was removed when the Continental Congress declared him a traitor in 1780. During the War of 1812 the British captured the cannon in Detroit.  General William Henry Harrison's forces recaptured it October 5, 1813 at the Battle of Thames in Ontario, Canada. How this cannon came to the Hayes Presidential Center not yet known. It probably was obtained by Rutherford B. Hayes while President of the United States. According to an Ohio Archeological and Historical Society Publication (Vol. 16, 1907), it was displayed for more than 25 years in the museum on the site of old Fort Stephenson (now Birchard Library). </provenance>

		<notes>Called a "sack-back" chair in Winkler's 1999 Furnishing Plan. The Plan also notes that this chair appears in the "library parlor" in 19th c. photos. The Hayes Home Guide Notes refer to "Windsor chairs " in the Birchard Room and Wright Room. See "A" file for a copy of the history of the "Windsor" chair. Custer's Antique's 1984 appraisal refers to "2 straight Windsor chairs." A piece of the note from bottom of chair is in an inert envelope in the "A" file.

My Dear Madame:
Mrs. Hayes joins me in thanking you warmly for the very interesting and beautiful reminder of our visit to Vancouver -- the excellent picture of Mt. Hood [sic]. It will be kept and cherished not only for itself but as a memorial of an agreeable visit and acquaintance not likely to be ever forgotten.

Sincerely,
R.B. Hayes

This letter was acquired from Maury A. Bromson, Boston, MS. on May 13, 1974. See Ms. Ac. #2211. See "A" file for copy of letter.

		<provenance>there is conflicting information about this painting. It was supposedly painted by Miss Isabella S. Haughey from Vancouver, Washington Territory but the signed initials on the painting read "MAG"(perhaps this is Gerrish's initials) and a note on the back of the painting reads Port Townsend, W. T. instead of Vancouver, W. T. It was given to President and Lucy Hayes by Mrs. Gerrish in October, 1880. The 1930 inventory of paintings list Haughey as the artist.
Preliminary research, based on the letter written by President Hayes, suggests that this is a painting of Mt. Hood, painted by Gerrish, and given to President and Mrs. Hayes by Isabella Haughey. This research was done in 2005 did not resolve the question of who chaged "Mt. Hood" to Mt. Rainier. It was also noted that the provenance on back of the painting was written in 2 different scripts(the bottom one looks like the President's writing). Further research (newspaper accounts etc.) may clear the matter up.</provenance>

		<notes>Sideboard ordered made by Pres. and Lucy Hayes in 1880, and carved by Henry L. Fry of Cincinnati, Ohio; Fry also carved a matching buffet table used later by Pres. Arthur on which to display his White House china; sideboard was sold, with other "surplus" White House furniture, in January, 1903, to Joseph M. Frank, beer garden proprietor, in Washington, D. C., for $85.00, who thereafter asked $3000.00 for it.  Col. Webb C. Hayes refused to buy it at that prise.  Franck claimed to have turned down $5000.00 for the sideboard in 1905, when, retired, he set out to substantiate reports that the sideboard had been a gift of Cincinnati W. C. T.U. to Lucy Hayes, this despite the statement of Col. Bingham, Supt. of Public Buildings and Grounds that the sideboard had been purchased by the government from Mr. Fry.  At various times, the Hayes Library had refused to pay prices such as $18,000.00 for the sideboard, until October 21, 1967, when Watt P. Marchman, director of the Hayes Library, paid $2500.00 to Joseph M. Franks, owner, of Lovettsville, VA (Rose Antique shop, agent, Washington, D. C.) purchase order no. 1811.</notes>

See "A" file for sheet from Ohiohistory.com which says this weapon was brought to a military man by a repentent Rebel. GNY stands for Gossport Navy Yard. There were 10,000 of these weapons made and 5,000 ended up in New York and were altered. Many of these rifles were captured from Union soldiers by the Confederates and then recaptured later. According to Bruce Bazelon, Pennsylvania Historical Museum, this is a rare item and in very nice condition.</notes>

After researching original pictures of the library in the President's time, it was decided that this chair appears in the 19th century photographs of the library and the one in the home was actually a bequest of Lucy Elliott Keeler in 1929.
Was apparently damaged, possibly by a museum patron (see incident report in file)

		<provenance>wine glass from the President  Lincoln set of stemware brought to Spiegel Grove by Rutherford and Lucy Hayes from the White House.

Hayes the hospitalities and freedom of the city of San Fransisco. Resolved, that the President be requested to appoint a committee of five members of this Board to confer and act in conjunction with such a number of citizens as they shall deem proper for purpose of making the necessary arrangements and extending the courtesies, proper attendance and welcome to our distinguished citizen upon his arrival and during his stay in this city. In Board of Supervisors of San Fransisco, Cal. August 30th, 1880. Adopted by Unanimous Vote Supervisors Anton Schottler, John Mason, J. M. Litchfield, Samuel Drake, James D.

		<descrip>A round orange print cardboard candy box. It has a very intricate and detailed design in the orange print of the box. There is a paper label on the outside of the box that reads, "SPIEGEL GROVE, BED ROOM STUDY. 17 Jan. 1893." The inside of the box is white and on the box lid has (in fancy print) the name, "Maillard." The candy box became a storage box for trinkets and souvenirs after its original contents were consumed. The contents of the box are as listed: (1) A souvenir hatchet, 4.2 cm. in length, with a red ribbon tied in a small hole on the hatchet handle, that has the text, "G.W. CENTENNIAL 1789-1889," stamped into it. (2) A stick pin, 6.1 cm. in length, with two horses heads on the top of it; with a maker's mark stamped into the back of it that reads, "STERLING," and is situated in a half cirlce. Inside of the half circle is a four-leaf clover. (3) A long black (velvet) necklace type item with minute white beads sewn into it for decoration. It is 81 cm. in diameter. (4) A thin brass drawer handle. (5) A paper card that held "DeLong Hook and Eyes" hangers. (6) Two pines cones. (7) A mini sea-shell beads necklace. (8) A miniature bottle in the form of a clump of grapes that has a dried-up liquid, that may be wine or grape juice, with its original cork. It is 4.4 cm. in height. (9) A broken red ribbon with a metal wrapping around it. (10) A long brass pin that has a sharp point at one end and some sort of triangular design at the other end that has three points. There is an intricate design painted onto the three pointed triangular design. It is 17.3 cm. in length. (11) An amber polymer piece that appears to be broken off of something. (12) Not for certain, but what appears to be a shaving cream applicator. There is a paper label with unreadable text, along the date of 1830 written on the bottom of the label. (13) A souvenir flag with a red base that has the Union Jack in the upper left hand corner. The text on the front of the flag reads, "FINANCE. KEEP RESERVE IN AMERICAN GOLD WHICH IS CURRENT AT PAR ALL OVER THE CONTINENT. HENRY W. DARLING." The text on the back of the flag reads, SOUVENIR BANQUET &amp; TESTIMONIAL To HENRY W. DARLING. Retiring President of the Toronto Board of Trade. ROSSIR HOUSE. Wednesday, Feb. 16th 1887." (14) A membership ribbon (with the primary colors of red, yellow, blue and gold) of the "Society of the ARMY of West Virginia." There is a brown bald eagle on the ribbon with a star in one of the upper corners. It also has gold tassels on the bottom of the ribbon. (15) A miniature wooden stand that has a folding support stand in the shape of a tree or tree branch.</descrip>
