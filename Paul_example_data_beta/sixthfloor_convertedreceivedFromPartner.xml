		<Description>Black and white undated photograph of FBI agents demonstrating how President Kennedy and Governor Connally may have been struck by a single bullet. The car in the photo was originally the Secret Service vehicle following directly behind President Kennedy during the shooting.  The two agents are sitting in approximately the same positions as President Kennedy and Governor Connally were in the presidential limousine. Note the chalk marks on their backs showing the bullet entrance locations on both men.  The third man, Warren Commission staff member Arlen Specter, stands beside the car with a metal rod to show the possible trajectory of the bullet through the two men based on measurements made during the May 1964 reenactment in Dallas.  \n
This copy of a photograph was part of FBI Special Agent Lyndal Shaneyfelt's Kennedy assassination file; Shaneyfelt assisted in the FBI investigations of the assassination conducted on behalf of the Warren Commission in 1964.</Description>

		<Description>Original 8mm color home movie of President Kennedy's funeral procession in Washington, D. C. shot by Dr. George Christian.  The movie shows the White House and Treasury Department buildings on November 25, 1963, the day of President Kennedy's funeral.  Then, on Pennsylvania Avenue near what is now Freedom Park, Christian caught the funeral cortege as it proceeded to Arlington National Cemetery.  Near the front of the funeral cortege, behind the president's casket, came the symbolic "riderless horse," Black Jack, followed by members of the Kennedy family in cars.  Similar scenes appeared on live TV, but only as black and white images.</Description>

		<Description>Two 8mm color home movie reels taken by George Reid, a long-time Kennedy supporter. These are among several filmed by Reid from 1963 to 1967.\n
On November 22, 1963, Reid arrived at Dallas Love Field two hours early and filmed some of the preparations for, and later the arrival of, the Kennedys.  His scenes include students with their high school and Texas state flags, a Belgian exchange student waiting to show her brother's sketches to the Kennedys, and Secret Service agents guarding the Kennedy limousine.  

Reid filmed the presidential arrival and the Kennedys in the crowd until he ran out of film; by the time he reloaded, the motorcade had departed.  His last scene that day showed his neighborhood post office.  Some other later scenes included in this excerpt show crowds, television news crews and police in Dealey Plaza as well as the Dallas Criminal Courts Building.  Later films, not included here, show people and events in Dealey Plaza over the next four years including CBS News filming re-creation scenes in 1967 for a Kennedy assassination program.

"11/24/63
 
 1417 N. Bronson Ave
 Hollywood 28, Calif.

Dear Jack-
		 I think I know what prompted you to pull that trigger - Wish I could have done it - It was not only your finger on that trigger but, the fingers of a hundred and eighty million americans - 
		 Im with you boy - all you did was get rid of a crummy rat. I think right or wrong you did what I would have like to have done - 
		                Sincerely
		                Les Parker"

The letter also has two sets of signed initials by the date in the upper right hand corner.  As with any county prisoner, Jack Ruby's mail was collected and read by Dallas County deputy sheriffs before being passed along to Ruby.</Description>

		<Description>Handwritten note from Jack Ruby to his lawyer Melvin Belli. The note is written in pencil on a small piece of paper.\n
In response to Detective Jim Leavelle’s testimony during Ruby’s trial for the murder of Oswald in 1964, Ruby passed this note to his attorneys, suggesting that his hat would have obscured his face.  

Text of letter: 

"R (circled) IMPORTANT
The gun did not have a hammer, and is almost impossible to stop from firing even if you grasp same.
		    
Also I was wearing a hat, so how could he tell the expression on my face, and he was hand-cuffed to the prisoner"

Air Force One is the plane on the right and it carried Kennedy; Lyndon Johnson’s plane, Air Force Two with the red nose and tail, is in the middle, and a commercial Pan American jet for members of the press is at left.  

The unidentified man at right is presumably a Love Field or FAA employee.  Dallas Police provided security at the airport that day and some were stationed on rooftops, but they were dressed in standard police uniforms.</Description>

The sign is made of porcelain-coated metal. It is a pinkish-brown color with three-dimensional cream-colored letters that are each bolted separately onto the face of the sign. The sign disassembles into four pieces that attach with bolt and bolt holes on the sides of each piece. The full sign reads "TEXAS SCHOOL BOOK DEPOSITORY".</Description>

		<Description>Original 8mm color home movie by Orville Nix showing the presidential motorcade in Dealey Plaza.  \n
The Nix home movie of the Kennedy assassination was taken from near the corner of Main and Houston streets nearly a block away from the site of the assassination.  It begins with the Kennedy limousine moving north on Houston Street toward the Texas School Book Depository, then shows the fatal shot to Kennedy's head on Elm Street.  The “grassy knoll” is in the background as Jackie Kennedy climbs onto the trunk and is met by Secret Service agent Clint Hill.  Photographer Abraham Zapruder can be seen on top of a white pedestal farther back from the street.  A third sequence, about 30 seconds later, shows bystanders running to the scene.  

Nix returned the next morning and filmed the same general area.  Eight days later, he and his son finished the film reel by filming a family member – the majorette – at a high school football game in Fort Worth, Texas.

		<Description>A pamphlet titled “Kennedy and the Religious Issue” put out by the Committee for Religious Freedom.  G.M. Pedley is listed as the committee's chairman.\n
The pamphlet consists of a single sheet of paper folded in half across its vertical axis to create four pages.  The cover, printed in blue, includes both the title and a head-and-shoulders portrait of John F. Kennedy.  The text of the pamphlet appears on the inside and back cover, also printed in blue.  

The text of the pamphlet consists of ten numbered points. Nine of the points consist of quotes from Kennedy that address various concerns related to his adherence to Catholicism, specifically that his faith might take precedence over or hinder his responsibilities as president.  The tenth point quotes the Constitution.

The points listed include: 
1. Separation of Church and State
2. Pressure from the Catholic Church or Church Officials
3. The Question of an Ambassador to the Vatican

		<Description>Original 8mm color home movie filmed by Robert Hughes.  This film is the only home movie known to include a view of the assassin's window of the Texas School Book Depository when President Kennedy was in Dealey Plaza.  Unfortunately, because Hughes filmed from a block away, the moving shape in the window cannot be identified.  \n
After filming the presidential motorcade until just a few seconds before the first shot, Hughes filmed some of the aftermath of the shooting including the search for suspects in a railroad yard and outside the Book Depository building.

		<Description>Videotaped oral history interview with Clint Hill.  Hill jumped onto the back of the presidential limousine during the assassination - an action recorded in numerous photographs and home movies and which later made him the most recognized U.S. Secret Service agent on the Kennedy detail. He received an award for his service and continued to protect Mrs. Kennedy for one year after the shooting.  Deeply affected by the assassination, Hill was reluctant to speak about the tragedy for years. In 2010, he collaborated with Gerald Blaine and Lisa McCubbin on the book "The Kennedy Detail."\n
