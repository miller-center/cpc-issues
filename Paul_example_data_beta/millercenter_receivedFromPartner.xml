		<summary>Frank Carlucci describes his role in the Reagan national security team, and his experiences as Deputy Secretary of Defense, National Security Advisor, and Secretary of Defense. The interview begins at the early stages of his 25-year career as a Foreign Service Officer, where he recounts his job at the U.S. Embassy in Congo. The discussion then jumps ahead to Carlucci's first stint in the Reagan White House as Deputy Secretary of Defense during the first two years of the administration, focusing largely on budget and procurement issues. The interview moves forward again to the final two years of the administration when Carlucci served as the National Security Advisor, then Secretary of Defense. Carlucci discusses Reagan's management and decision-making style, frequently emphasizing the residual effects the Iran-Contra affair had on the administration, particularly Reagan's inability to get past the event. He also examines key foreign policy events of the 1987-88 period; specifically, the Persian Gulf reflagging effort, Panama, covert operations, and, most importantly, superpower detente.</summary>

The entry point of the interview is Bowen’s decision to join the Reagan administration in November 1985 and the policy agenda being constructed by HHS at that time. The interview is essentially a comprehensive overview of HHS policy during Reagan’s second term, with in-depth discussion on every major issue, including Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, sex education, nicotine addiction, welfare, drug and alcohol abuse, and the catastrophic health insurance bill. Very little is said about President Reagan in the course of the interview, with the exception of his role in getting the catastrophic health insurance initiative passed.</summary>

Nofziger begins by discussing his role in Reagan's 1966 campaign for the California governorship, and his subsequent role as Press Secretary in the Sacramento. He touches briefly on Reagan's aborted 1968 presidential run against Richard Nixon before delving into the 1976 campaign and his challenge to incumbent President Gerald Ford. As a top aide, Nofziger describes the key events of the campaign from his own perspective, particularly the early pressures for Reagan to drop out of the race, the selection of Richard Schweiker as the vice-presidential nominee, and the 1976 Republican National Convention. The 1980 campaign is discussed in similar detail, as Nofziger provides an overview of the race from the decision to run all the way to the victory and the transition into the White House. In the final part of the interview, Nofziger examines his one-year tenure as Assistant to the President for Political Affairs, his brief return to the White House in August 1982 to organize support for the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act, and his role in the 1984 reelection campaign.</summary>

		<summary>Kathleen Osborne looks back on her years as the personal assistant of Ronald Reagan during his gubernatorial years and his eight years as President. Osborne played no policy or advisory role to Reagan, so the interview takes a more conversational tone as she recounts her memories of Reagan. She begins with the California years, discussing the key events of his governorship, major policy issues, staff, and Reagan’s relationship with the California legislature. During her White House years, she came into frequent contact with top members of the administration, including James Baker, George Bush, Michael Deaver, and with the First Lady. She also discusses some of the trips she traveled with the President on (China, Moscow), and her observations on the major events of the presidency (Grenada, Lebanon, Challenger disaster, Iran-Contra). Osborne reveals a personal side of Reagan experienced by few others, and the image presented is one of a friendly and compassionate man with an infectious sense of humor and an undying love of country.</summary>

		<summary>Stuart Spencer examines his career as a campaign strategist for over four decades, and covers his work on Reagan's 1966 and 1970 gubernatorial campaigns and his 1980 and 1984 presidential campaigns. Spencer begins with the creation of his political consulting firm, Spencer-Roberts, in 1960, and his company's work on the 1960 and 1964 presidential elections. His role in Reagan's 1966 California gubernatorial bid and his 1970 reelection campaign are discussed in detail. Spencer also recounts his involvement in Reagan's three presidential campaigns; as a member of the Ford campaign in Reagan's failed 1976 bid for the GOP nominations, and as a top strategist in the 1980 and 1984 campaigns. Although he played a minor role in the administration, Spencer gives his observations on a range of issues, including the White House staff, the First Lady, and the Iran-Contra affair, which he was brought to the White House for as a special political aide. Spencer also briefly mentions his work on the Bush-Quayle campaigns in 1988 and 1992.</summary>

		<summary>Robert Tuttle gives his unique perspective on the rise of Ronald Reagan as a seminal figure in American politics, and on his four years of service as White House Personnel Director during the second Reagan term. As the son of Holmes Tuttle, a key member of the Reagan &quot;kitchen cabinet,&quot; Tuttle examines Reagan's entry into the political arena in the 1950s and 1960s and his rise from Governor of California to presidential contender. He recounts his service as Co-Chairman of the Reagan-Bush campaign in California in 1980, touching on several key issues of the campaign, including the involvement of the kitchen cabinet and the debate over the selection of former President Gerald Ford as Reagan's running mate. Tuttle and assistant Maureen Malloy discuss their four years in the White House Personnel Office, with a detailed analysis of the White House staff, the appointments process, congressional relations, and the Iran-Contra affair. Tuttle and Malloy also offer a wealth of personal stories which speak to Reagan's sense of humor, shyness, and affability.</summary>

		<summary>Peter Wallison gives a comprehensive look at the role and organization of the White House Counsel's Office during the Reagan years, and the central role it played in personnel selection, judicial appointments, and, most importantly, the Iran-Contra affair. Wallison begins with his entry into political life and his rise from a page in the House of Representatives to his service as a special assistant, and later counsel, to Nelson Rockefeller. He discusses his accomplishments as General Counsel of the Treasury Department for the first Reagan term, and his work with Secretary Donald Regan, whom Wallison describes as a nice man with an undeservedly negative reputation. Wallison examines his appointment as White House Counsel in March 1986 and the structure and responsibilities of that office during the Reagan administration. A large portion of the interview is devoted to the Iran-Contra affair, which Wallison recollects in remarkable detail, covering the evolution of the misguided operation, its effect on the White House and President Reagan, the congressional and independent counsel investigations, and his departure from the White House in March 1987.</summary>

		<summary>Jimmy Carter gives a comprehensive look at his entry into national politics and his four years as President of the United States. Carter begins by discussing his decision to pursue the presidency shortly after the 1972 Democratic National Convention and his reflections from the 1976 presidential campaign. Considerable time is given to the transition and early months of the administration, as Carter attempted to adjust to Washington politics, formulate his policy agenda, and organize the White House Staff, particularly in the wake of the Bert Lance resignation. Carter then examines his place within the administration – his involvement in policy construction, relations with Congress and the Cabinet, and his perspective of personnel issues (particularly the Brzezinski-Vance relationship). Carter also discusses the interaction between his administration and outside groups such as the Democratic Party, interest groups, and the media. The interview includes a substantive discussion of the major foreign policy issues of the term, including the Camp David accords, the SALT agreement, the Panama Canal treaty, and the Iran hostage crisis. Although not specifically addressed, Carter’s responses offer a penetrating insight into his personal worldview, his governing philosophy, and his management and decision-making style. Carter concludes with thoughts on how the presidency affected him personally and how he would have approached a second term in office.</summary>

		<summary>Hamilton Jordan joins Deputy Chief of Staff Landon Butler and congressional liaison Thomas Donilon to discuss President Carter, election politics, and their role in the Carter administration. The interview begins with Carter’s rise to the top of the Democratic Party and his victory over President Ford in 1976. The first year is explored in detail, specifically the administration’ failure to set clear priorities, the compartmentalization of issues, the fragmentation of the Democratic Party and its traditional supporters (labor, women, blacks, etc.), and the negative perception of the administration that developed as a result of these mistakes. Jordan also discusses his own role within the White House and the perception that he was the top advisor within the spokes on the wheel concept. He examines the so-called &quot;malaise speech&quot; and the subsequent Camp David staff review, and his appointment as Chief of Staff shortly after. As the first Chief of Staff of the Carter administration, Jordan assesses the organization of his office, his development as a strategist and planner, and his role in various foreign and domestic policy issue areas. Donilon joins Jordan and Butler for the afternoon session, which focuses on President Carter – his management style, skills as a politician, and view of the presidency. The interview ends with some thoughts on the 1980 presidential election – some of the key issues of the campaign (oil prices, hostage situation, Kennedy challenge) and how Jordan’s involvement with Iran policy diminished his role in the campaign.</summary>

		<summary>Charles Kirbo discusses his role as a close friend and key advisor to Jimmy Carter from his 1966 run for the Georgia governorship through his four years as president. Kirbo uses the entire interview to describe his position as an outside advisor to Carter throughout his political career and his perspectives on the inner-workings of the Carter White House. He examines the personalities and contributions of several top administration officials, including Hamilton Jordan, Stuart Eizenstat, Jody Powell, and Bert Lance. He also talks about his role in staffing the White House and the Cabinet, his own decision not to join the administration as Chief of Staff, the disconnect between perception and reality in the Carter presidency, and the 1980 presidential election. Finally, Kirbo offers an intimate portrait of Carter the individual, whom he describes as intelligent, determined, thorough, a principled conservative, and a man who has changed little since they first met in 1962.</summary>

		<summary>Philip Klutznick examines his role in the Carter administration as Secretary of Commerce and an advisor to President Carter on foreign policy in the Middle East. He begins with a brief overview of his involvement in Middle East policy prior to 1976 and how he became involved in the administration’s dealings with Jewish leaders and the state of Israel. He details Secretary of State Vance’s work on the peace accord, and how the White House and National Security Council responded to the State Department’s efforts. Klutznick also assesses Carter’s role in the peace process, with a focus on his negotiating and communications skills. He discusses his continuing role as an advisor to President Carter on Israel policy and a liaison to the Jewish community even after becoming Commerce Secretary. Klutznick concludes by assessing his relationship with other Cabinet members, and some general thoughts on the relationship between the Cabinet and the White House Staff.</summary>

		<summary>As one of Jimmy Carter’s closest and most trusted advisors, Bert Lance offers a penetrating look at Carter, on both an individual and professional level. He begins with the origins of his relationship with Carter in 1966 and his tenure as head of the Georgia Highway Department from 1970 to 1973. The majority of the session is dedicated to the Carter presidential years. Lance describes his role in staffing the White House and Cabinet, and participating in regular cabinet meetings in the early period of the administration. He examines Carter’s management style and the decisions not to have a Chief of Staff and to have a small White House staff with only a few Washington DC insiders, which Lance characterizes as a costly error on Carter’s part. He discusses his interactions with the legislative branch and the administration’s failure to cultivate better relations with Congress, which Lance foresaw as a potential problem early in the presidency. Considerable time is spent discussing Carter as a politician, with Lance asserting the Carter is very political when seeking office, but generally does not like politicians and makes his decisions based on what is right, not what is politically expedient. Lance admits that during his short tenure (and for the remainder of the first year), the administration took on more policies than they could handle – water projects, stimulus package, energy bill, B-1 bomber, etc. Yet, for all of the accurate criticisms levied at the administration, he maintains there were major differences between how the presidency was viewed by the public and how it actually worked. Lance concludes by asserting that Carter could have been a great president if events such as the energy shortage and the Iran hostage crisis had not hurt him.</summary>

		<summary>In this brief interview session, Ray Marshall discusses politics and policymaking in the Labor Department during the Carter presidency. He begins with his decision to join the administration as Labor Secretary and his initial discussions with Carter on the priorities of the department, including changes to OSHA regulations, a jobs program, and hiring of women and minorities. Marshall discusses the organization of the Labor Department and key staffing decisions. He describes his interactions with Carter and with labor leaders, and highlights the often contentious relationship between Carter and AFL-CIO President George Meany. He also examines his work on key labor policies during his tenure, including inflation, the coal strike, and a lengthy discussion on minimum wage. Marshall concludes with some general thoughts on the role of the Labor Secretary, which he believes should be as a consensus builder between government, business, and organized labor.</summary>

		<summary>Alonzo McDonald discusses his experiences as Special Representative for Trade Negotiations and White House Staff Director in the Carter administration. Day One begins with an overview of McDonald’s service in the Carter administration – how he joined the administration in August 1977 then transferred to the White House in 1979 after the Camp David staff review – as well as some general thoughts on the presidency. During this session, McDonald examines his role as White House Staff Director, how he ran the daily White House operation, and his affect on organization, management, communications, speechwriting, and policymaking. He explores the relationship between Carter and the Congress, and more broadly, recent developments in executive-legislative relations. At the beginning of Day Two, McDonald delivers a lengthy introduction covering his role in the White House, Carter as president, and some general thoughts on the administration. He describes the role of White House Staff Director as an honest broker with little involvement in policy, and highlights the individuals with whom he worked most closely in the White House, Cabinet, and Congress. He describes Carter as intelligent, selfless, compassionate, moderate, and apolitical, and notes the distinction between his image in the press and the reality of Carter’s character. Finally, he assesses the roles of the principals and deputies in the White House, touching on major players such as Jordan, Powell, Strauss, Moore and Watson. The remainder of the interview touches on what McDonald calls the &quot;four presidencies,&quot; or four phases of each administration, and takes a look back at the successes and failures of the Carter presidency.</summary>

		<summary>James McIntyre joins two of his associates at OMB, congressional liaison Hubert Harris and chief economist Van Ooms, to discuss the administration’s economic policy and some general thoughts on the Carter presidency. Each of the three officials participates equally in the interview, which takes the form of a roundtable discussion with the interview team serving as moderators. It begins with the early months of the presidency; how the OMB was organized and the policy issues immediately facing the new economic team (1978 amended budget, 1979 budget, reorganization plans, etc.). For the remainder of the first day, the interviewees examine various issues (inflation, balanced budget), processes (budget task force, Carter’s role in policymaking, interactions with Congress and the public), and OMB’s role in setting the administration’s policy agenda. Also covered is how the rest of the White House apparatus (organization of the White House Staff, decision-making structure, coordination of policy, and relations with Congress) affected economic policymaking. Day Two of the interview steps back from economic policy and focuses on broader topics regarding the Carter presidency. A variety of issues — Carter as a politician, the domestic policy staff, the &quot;malaise&quot; speech, and what a second Carter term would have looked like — are covered in detail.</summary>

		<summary>Richard Moe chronicles his work as Chief of Staff to Vice President Walter Mondale. He begins with the development of Mondale’s vice-presidential role during the 1976 campaign and transition, particularly Carter’s desire for a strong vice president and the integration of the VP’s staff with the White House staff. He discusses Mondale’s role in the transition period and the Cabinet selection process, and the administration’s early efforts to court constituency groups and the Washington establishment. Moe describes the first year of the presidency as a failure to frame and execute priorities and the administration’s troubles in working with Congress and creating coalitions. He outlines the organization of the White House staff and his interactions with key figures (Jordan, Watson), and the strong role of the Cabinet. Moe offers his perceptions of Mondale’s operating style and his interactions with Carter and Congress. He also comments on Carter’s approach to governing – how he received information, and the use of polls and task forces. The first day ends with a long discussion on the Camp David personnel summit, the &quot;malaise&quot; speech, subsequent staff changes, and Mondale’s role. Day Two begins with a discussion of economic policy, particularly inflation and the budget, and the role of Mondale and Carter. He talks again at length about the operating style of both Carter and Mondale. The interview concludes with Moe’s thoughts on the 1980 campaign, what a second Carter term would have looked like, and the successes and failures of the Carter presidency.</summary>

		<summary>Jody Powell and a group of his top aides examine the organization, function and operations of the White House press office during the Carter presidency. The morning session on Day One explores the transition from the 1976 presidential campaign to the early months of the administration, and how the Carter White House, and the press office in particular, came to be organized. In the afternoon session, Powell and his colleagues detail the range, scope, and nature of press office functions, including the media liaison’s office (Bario), national security press operation (Friendly), news summary (Townsend), and press advance (Leibach). On the second day of the interview, broader topics on the Carter presidency are investigated, including interactions between Carter and the White House Staff, and the relationship between the administration and the Democratic Party, the &quot;permanent press,&quot; and the Washington establishment. Finally, each of the interviewees offers their thoughts on the 1980 presidential election and how the Carter presidency will likely be viewed in history.</summary>

		<summary>James Schlesinger discusses his tenure as head of the newly created Department of Energy and the challenge of passing energy legislation. He begins with some opening comments about his relationship with Carter and the &quot;freshness of approach&quot; Carter brought to Washington in 1977. He offers an intimate profile of the President, detailing his operating style (hands-on president), his personality (intelligent, moral), and his skill as a politician (na&Atilde;&macr;ve, unable to create governing coalitions). Schlesinger chronicles the creation and development of the Department of Energy, how it was initially staffed, and how it formulated and sold policy. He examines Carter’s deep interest in energy policy and his desire for comprehensive legislation. Schlesinger then delivers a detailed presentation of the 1977 and 1979 energy proposals – the creation and sale of these policies, and the effect of outside events on the policies – passage. He also discusses other issues he worked on as Energy Secretary, including the neutron bomb, the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, and policy toward Iran, China, and Panama. Various other issues, such as the Bert Lance affair, Carter’s relations with the press, and public perceptions of Carter, are discussed throughout the course of the interview. Schlesinger concludes by predicting that history will remember the Carter presidency well, particularly its work on the Panama Canal, the Camp David Accords, and normalization of relations with China.</summary>

		<summary>Jack Watson discusses his experiences as Transition Director, Assistant to the President for Intergovernmental Affairs, Cabinet Secretary, and Chief of Staff in the Carter administration. Watson and his aides each begin with the circumstances surrounding their entry into the administration and their key roles and responsibilities during their tenures. A variety of topics, including the transition, the problems of not having a Chief of Staff early in the presidency, the interaction between policy formulation and implementation, and the relationship between the administration and state and local governments, are highlighted in these remarks. For the remainder of the session, the interview team explores several broad themes relevant to Watson’s service in the administration. The first area focuses on the White House Staff, including organizational issues (spokes-on-the-wheel concept, effects of Watergate, post-Camp David personnel changes, key officials) and Watson’s tenure (becoming chief of staff, role in policymaking, interactions with other White House offices). Next is a discussion of cabinet affairs, with Watson’s reflections on cabinet selection, cabinet meetings, and Carter’s relationship with cabinet members. Day Two begins with an evaluation of Watson’s responsibilities as intergovernmental affairs chief, his role in the 1980 election, and some thoughts on transition management. Finally, Watson gives a retrospective look at the challenges and achievements of the Carter presidency, and how it should be remembered by historians.</summary>

		<summary>Anne Wexler joins three of her White House colleagues for a discussion on coalition building and selling legislation during the Carter presidency. Wexler begins with an overview of her service with the Carter administration, covering her work on the 1976 Cabinet selection team, her tenure as Deputy Undersecretary of Commerce, how she came to join the Office of Public Liaison in May 1978, and a brief overview of her responsibilities. The majority of the interview is spent on Wexler’s time in the White House, beginning with the legislative process and the creation of coalitions. The group discusses their interactions with a variety of groups, including Congress, interest groups, state and local party officials, constituent groups, PACs, and the Washington establishment. They examine the division labor between the Office of Public Liaison and other Cabinet and White House offices, particularly the Office of Congressional Liaison. They also share their perceptions of the Carter White House, how it was organized and developed over time, working relationships between staffers, and some of the key personalities (Powell, Jordan, Caddell, Rafshoon). Wexler discusses her observations of Carter’s role in the legislative process, his operating style, and his interactions with Congress and the media. She concludes by asserting that the Carter administration compiled an impressive record of legislative achievements, but a poor communications strategy failed to convince the nation that Carter was moving the country forward.</summary>
