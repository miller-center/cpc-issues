         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">There is no one to introduce the speaker of the evening except myself. I would fain commend my friend to your indulgent hearing. He is essentially a modest man, but he is accustomed to utter certain ideas for the pleasure of intellectual adventure. There is no way in which to avoid life’s falling dull unless you propose things which at least arouse discussion; and he professes to have found, in his brief experience as a college president, that no one is more serviceable to you than the men who oppose your ideas. My friend tells me that his ideas have been more perfected by those who have opposed them than by himself. They have enabled him to see the points at which they needed adjustment, the points at which they needed to be guarded, the points which would make them efficacious in execution. It is such a person, so disposed to learn, so new in learning in his present position, whom I have the pleasure of introducing to you this evening.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The topic I have chosen is one which allows me plenty of sea room. Speaking on “School and College,” one can give himself leave to say almost anything about education that it pleases him to say; and I think that one of the greatest interests that attaches to our generation is, that almost everything regarding education has to be said over again.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">We have just passed through a period in education when everything seemed in process of dissolution, when all standards were removed, when there was a universal dispersion of every established conception; when men did not hold themselves to plans, but opened the whole field, as if you drew a river out of its courses and invited it to spread abroad over the countryside. For there was a time in the generation which preceded our own, when education was confined within very narrow courses, when it did not sufficiently fertilize the great areas of educational interest—of intellectual interests; and it was the task of that particular generation to see that the waters were no longer confined to a little territory, but were allowed to spread abroad over a great new land.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">To come out of my figure, we have just passed through a period when the whole domain of knowledge has been added to by subject after subject, and when it was absolutely necessary that the boundaries should be constantly enlarged in order that we might include the new things that had come to engage the human mind.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">It does not make very much difference how you define the features of the period through which we have passed. The term under which we generally designate it is “the elective system of studies.” I received a catalogue from a college the other day, a college not ancient in its foundation, in which it was stated that the institution was ready to offer 365 courses, and would offer any others upon the demand of as many as five students. In other words, this institution, like its elders and betters, had undertaken to put upon its curriculum almost every known subject of study, and had put all those subjects of study upon its curriculum upon an equal footing, not presuming to suggest to the student which were the greater subjects and which the minor; not presuming to point out to him what was the natural point of entrance and the natural point of exit, but inviting him to enter anywhere and go any whither in his search for knowledge throughout a vast and various field.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">This is what I have called the period of dispersion, the period of the dissolution of standards, when we do not undertake to say that one study is more worth while than another study, but say to every student: “Judge for yourself, by your own tastes to begin with, which studies are most worth while for you; and sit you down to a free feast!”</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Not only so, but we have just passed through a period abounding in pedagogical theories. We have been doing nothing else than make reckless experiments upon lads and youths, upon girls and maidens, for the purpose of testing newfangled notions which we put forth out of intellectual curiosity more than out of deep conviction. I was talking not long ago to a very interesting lady, who was trying to expound to me some of the new theories of education, finding me to be a very ignorant person; and she was talking to me about the individual child, and the sociologic child, and various other kinds of children until I became confused; and I said, “I beg your pardon, but I am afraid I don’t know what you are talking about”; and she said, “Perhaps it is the terms I am using.” “No,” I replied; “I am afraid it is the ideas you are using.” She was representing each child as having a sort of section here and there in its intellectual biology which made it necessary to treat one section of the child after one chemistry of development and another layer of the child after another chemistry of development. I had never met children so sectionalized; I had never been aware that I had myself developed out of such an incomplete and un–united series of sections; and so I was confused not by her terminology (for I understood what the words meant), but by her ideas, for I was unable to grasp them.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">And yet she was perfectly serious; she was very capable; and she was subjecting the children whom she dealt with to experimentation upon the basis of these theories. You know perfectly well what the result has been; you know that the children of the past two or three decades in our schools have not been educated. You know that the pupils in the colleges in the last several decades have not been educated. You know that with all our teaching we train nobody; you know that with all our instructing we educate nobody. I say you know this—not meaning that you will admit it in a public discussion, but that when you are alone upon your knees at night you would feel obliged to confess it.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I have had the experience (which I am sure is common to modern teachers) of feeling that I was bending all my efforts to do a thing which was not susceptible of being done, and that the teaching that I professed to do was as if done in a vacuum, as if done without a transmitting medium, as if done without an atmosphere in which the forces could be transmitted. I am not indicting other persons any more than I am indicting myself. I have been teaching now for nearly twenty years; I have been conducting classroom exercises for nearly twenty years; and I don’t think I have been teaching any appreciable portion of that time. I have been delivering lectures which I meant to be interesting; I have been saying things some of which I knew; I have been repeating other things—many other things—which I have heard; I have been putting together views of knowledge much more systematic than my own investigations warranted me in putting together; and the result has been that my pupils have for the most part remembered my stories and forgotten my lectures. Because it is one of the privileges of a teacher, I think, to be bored, himself, with his own lecture and to allow himself to depart once and again from the course of the lecture in order to tell a story which has more or less connection with what he is saying.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I wish to state these things, if need be, in an extravagant form, in order to have you realize that we are upon the eve of a period of reconstruction. We are upon the eve of a period when we are going to set up standards. We are upon the eve of a period of synthesis, when, tired of this dispersion and standardless analysis, we are going to put things together into something like a connected and thought-out scheme of endeavor. It is inevitable; I never attend any gathering of this kind that I do not hear the frankest admissions that we are in search of the fundamental principles of the thing that we are trying to do.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">It is certainly a most favorable state of mind in which to enter a new age. No man who knows the history of knowledge would think of impeaching the men who have been responsible for the dissolution of standards, because until the old narrow curricula were shattered it was impossible to include in our conception of learning all those great new bodies of knowledge which have arisen almost within the lifetime of men now living. It is only since about 1850 that the great bodies of science which we now teach have come into existence in teachable form; and it is only within that time that science has won its place among the great disciplines of the human mind; it is only within that period that we have taken the physical universe within the boundaries of our comprehension and have tried to make men acquainted, not merely with the things which proceed out of their own consciousness, but also with the things which proceed out of their own environment. It was necessary that the old hard-and-fast bodies of study should be broken in upon like antiquated fortresses, a new garrison put in, and all knowledge given leave at any rate to be brought into the syntheis which we were subsequently to attempt.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">You will notice that whenever we have a serious discussion, such as the discussions which have characterized the sessions of this Association to-day, we find ourselves confused, because we are talking about several different things at the same time, and are sometimes misled into supposing that we are talking about one and the same thing. We are not often enough aware that in speaking of education—present-day education—we are really speaking of two things and not of one thing. We must discriminate the two things of which the modern age stands in need. It stands in need, in the first place, of technical training: the great majority of our young people must be made mechanics. I do not mean <render as="italic" rend="inherit">merely</render> mechanics of the hand, but mechanics <render as="italic" rend="inherit">also</render> of the mind. They must be given some skilled capacity to accomplish certain definite and narrow tasks—must be given technical training—all those things which lead up to skill in particular material occupations and which are more necessary in our age than they ever were in any preceding age. There is almost no limit to the number of expert intellectual or manual mechanics which this age needs. The number of technical things there are to be understood, the number of technical things there are to be done, the number of technical things there are to be combined is almost beyond calculation. The majority of our youth must be given an exact and thorough technical training. That is one of the things this age needs; and if you count heads, it is the main thing that this age needs.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">But in education we don’t count heads: that is to say, we don’t count the outsides of them. There is another sort of education which this age needs, and needs more than any preceding age: that kind which for many ages has borne amongst us the name of liberal education. If ever an age stood in need of men capable of seeing the invisible things, it is the age in which we live. If ever an age stood in need of the statesmanship of mind, this is that age; if ever an age stood in need of men lifted a little above their fellows in their point of view, who can see the significance of knowledge and of affairs, this is the age. If our great army of workers is to be left to work with their gaze concentrated upon the task, and there is no one to see visions, no one to order the field, no one to organize the great functions of mind and of organized effort of which we stand in need every day—why, then, we shall stumble upon immediate disaster. We are in need as no age ever was of liberal education; there are so many things to co-ordinate in our thinking that we sadly stand in need of thinkers. When I speak of education, therefore, I mean a liberal education as distinguished from technical training, for it is to that theme I wish to confine myself this evening.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I am speaking of something which we too often leave out of our reckoning when we are thinking of our schools and colleges. I don’t need to tell this company that information is not education; and I need only point out to you that in the great bulk of the work that we do in our schools and colleges, we are seeking nothing more than to impart information. We are seeking to communicate bodies of fact. Now, bodies of fact do not educate. Information is not an education. Information may clog the powers of the mind instead of drawing them forth. Information, unless the mind has the scope and grasp to digest and order it, is merely an impediment to the action of the mind. <personRef reg="Joseph R. Wilson" link-pointer-type="person">My father</personRef> was in the habit of using very explicit English; and one of the things I remember him saying to me in one of the very early stages of my own education was this: “My <personRef refurl="x4000418" reg="Woodrow Wilson" link-pointer-type="person">son</personRef>,” he said, “the mind is not a prolix gut to be stuffed.”</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Now, when you think of the prolixity of the gut which is stretched back from the day of college graduation to the day of entering upon the primary school and think of the systematic stuffing it has undergone ever since the process was begun, you don’t need to be told that there has been no process of digestion whatever. The figure is coarse only because we regard one of the words in it as coarse. It is true—as true as any material figure can be to a spiritual fact. It behooves us, therefore, to see what we are going to choose as our ideal standards in education. I mean, what we are going to understand education to be, let me again say, as distinguished from technical training, which I am not disparaging, but which I am now seeking to discriminate from this other thing.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">It seems to me that the idea of education involves three things: it involves in the first place enlightenment. I read a very whimsical essay the other day by that delightful newer essayist of ours, <person link-pointer-type="person">Mr. Crothers</person>, entitled “The Anglo-Saxon School of Polite Unlearning.” <person link-pointer-type="person">Mr. Crothers</person> pretends to have discovered in an out-of-the-way part of <place reg="London, England" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">London</place> a school whose object is to dispossess persons of their erroneous prepossessions, acting upon the principle that the trouble with us is the number of things that we know that we are not so; and one of the most interesting pupils represented to be in this school was an <place reg="Oxford University, England" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Oxford</place> graduate, who was contemplating an early visit to the <place reg="The United States of America" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place>. They had there undertaken to unload him of his misinformation about the <place reg="The United States of America" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place>. One of the exercises they gave him was this: they gave him an extract from a <place reg="San Francisco, CA" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">San Francisco</place> newspaper saying that <person reg="[Jack O'Brien]?" link-pointer-type="person">O’Brien</person>, the well-known pugilist, was now devoting himself to literary studies and, under the guidance of a tutor, was reading <person reg="Homer" link-pointer-type="person">Homer</person>, <person reg="Dante Alighieri" link-pointer-type="person">Dante</person>, and <person reg="John Milton" link-pointer-type="person">Milton</person>, expecting, after he retired from the ring, to devote himself to literary pursuits. The <place reg="Oxford University, England" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Oxford</place> man was directed to write an essay upon this extract showing how characteristic it was of a crude country to suppose that anybody was ready to study anything; “and then,” said his teacher, “after satisfying yourself by proving that you with your classical education are much better able to appreciate <person reg="Homer" link-pointer-type="person">Homer</person> than <person reg="[Jack O'Brien]?" link-pointer-type="person">O’Brien</person> is, ask yourself which <person reg="Homer" link-pointer-type="person">Homer</person> would have appreciated more—you or <person reg="[Jack O'Brien]?" link-pointer-type="person">O’Brien</person>.” It is so obvious that <person reg="Homer" link-pointer-type="person">Homer</person> would have preferred <person reg="[Jack O'Brien]?" link-pointer-type="person">O’Brien</person>! A stroke of insight and wit like that seems to strip away all the false paraphernalia with which we have surrounded classical learning and to set the Iliad up before us as an epic of the natural human being.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">A great deal of perception is to be got by thus unloading most of the unilluminated information which we have conveyed to our pupils, by stripping away ruthlessly all those adornments of careful, painstaking scholarship which have obscured the storied facts of human existence; and one flash of the perception that <person reg="Homer" link-pointer-type="person">Homer</person> would have loved <person reg="[Jack O'Brien]?" link-pointer-type="person">O’Brien</person> is more illuminating than all the<place reg="Oxford University, England" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Oxford</place> training with regard to the classics in that particular specimen of the <place reg="Oxford University, England" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Oxford</place> outlook. It at least renders <person reg="Homer" link-pointer-type="person">Homer</person> as he probably was. That is what I call enlightenment; it is letting in that very rare thing in college and school classrooms—illuminating perception of what the thing means.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">We are so punctilious about form in our teaching; we are so careful not to use gross words like the word gut; we are so careful to avoid the real facts of the case; we are so careful to obscure knowledge by interposing between the pupil and knowledge that great, thick, impenetrable body that we call information, the enormous, incalculable mass of irrelevant facts: facts irrelevant to the spiritual intent of the thing itself! It is a great deal better to see one thing than merely to look at a thousand; it is a great deal better to penetrate to the heart of some one mystery than to idly speculate about a score of mysteries. And so it is better to conduct the student to the interior <render as="italic" rend="inherit">penetralia</render> of some great subject than to take him on an excursion “Seeing Greater Knowledge.”</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Then there is another object in education; and that is what we have latterly grown into the habit of calling orientation—a word carrying certainly a very beautiful figurative meaning—that is to say, showing, with regard to some one thing perceived, how it stands related to the other things which the mind is capable of perceiving. There was a very interesting suggestion made in one of the discussions this forenoon when it was shown that our universities in their attempt to train teachers did not train the kind of teachers that would be most serviceable in the secondary schools because they did not train teachers who saw the relations of the particular things they taught to the larger bodies of knowledge to which they belonged. One of the speakers suggested that every university should have some one whose object it should be by some stimulating form of lecture to bring the students of pedagogical method to perceive that in handling any one subject they were moving in a particular part of the great domain of knowledge. It has always been a favorite idea of mine that every university should have a professor of things in general—that every university should have some one who would take the entering class and show them, as if upon a map, the great extending fields of knowledge: “Here lies biology, but close neighbor to it, so that you can hardly draw the frontiers, lies chemistry; and there close to chemistry (with boundaries again obscured) lies physics; and there alongside physics (again without scientific frontier) lies mathematics; and there, surrounding all this territory of related subjects, lie the great and sometimes shadowy territories of philosophy, our conception of what the human mind is capable of, of what the brain perceives, what the mind comprehends and what it is possible to establish by reason, the demonstrable, the undemonstrable, the purely speculative, the knowable. You are ever upon a continent of knowledge; you cannot look far abroad without seeing into other great territories of study. And all this territory has had an ancient and honorable history; up and down these great plains and upon these great slopes have moved the great armies of human thinkers.”</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">In the old ages, when they knew little of the history of thought, they went about among shadows, went about subject to many strange superstitions, which overcame them when they went out upon their expeditions to learn; but by slow degrees the mind’s conquests of arms were pushed forward; men went first into this <render as="italic" rend="inherit">terra incognita</render>, and there lies before us the map of the known world of knowledge.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">It seems to me that it would be possible for the youngster to find himself in any one subject by knowing how it stands related to its great neighbor subjects, and never after that feel that he was in contact with a mere body of information, but know that he was in the territory of a great kingdom where vital forces were afield and where any day some new flash of light might come to make the way plainer and the day broader.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">And so this business of orientation, of showing the youngster where he is, is one of the chief businesses of education. It is not necessary for the teacher alone; it is necessary also for the pupil, that he should know where he is. I cannot refrain from returning to a favorite illustration of mine (which I am sure some of my friends present have heard). When a man loses his way in a strange country you say that he has lost himself, and yet, in fact, that is the only thing he has <render as="italic" rend="inherit">not</render> lost: <render as="italic" rend="inherit">he</render> is <render as="italic" rend="inherit">there</render>. That is demonstrable, and he knows it. But <render as="italic" rend="inherit">he has lost all the rest of the world</render>. If he knew where any fixed point was, he could steer by it; but he doesn’t know any fixed point, and therefore he has lost all the rest of the world.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Now, if you take a human mind and put it in a strange country and leave it, it is there, but it hasn’t the least notion where it is; it is lost in the strictest sense of the word. That is, so far as its consciousness is concerned; it is nowhere at all. It has no relations to anything else. And you get the figure of orientation by knowing that if you only give that mind the notion of where the East is, it is easy after that to find the West and the North and the South and to box the whole compass; but not until some point of the compass is known.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">But there is another object of education. We have talked a great deal in our day about enlightenment and about orientation; but we have stopped talking about <render as="italic" rend="inherit">discipline</render>. The chief object of education is discipline. There is an old and trite illustration which must always be used, because it is the best illustration; that is, the illustration of the gymnasium. I have never heard of any youngster who went into the gymnasium because he expected to do the double trapeze with his partner in business when he graduated. I have never seen anything done in the gymnasium which was practical, in the sense in which we are now inclined to use that word with regard to the subject of education. All that the youngster in the gymnasium is trying to do is to get his muscles in such shape and the red corpuscles of his blood in such heart that he can do anything with himself physically that he wishes afterward; can stand the strains and be ready for all the sudden exertions of life; so that his heart will be used to having a strain put upon it and can pump, with slow and persistent complacency, when the utmost strains of life are put upon it at last.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">That is discipline of the body; and anything that can discipline the body is serviceable for the uses of our physical life. Similarly, anything—it is sometimes a matter of indifference what—that can discipline the mind is serviceable for our life intellectual; and what does not discipline the mind is not serviceable.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">If you accept that principle, then you cannot put all subjects of study upon an equality. Some things discipline the mind, and some do not. Some things are difficult and some things easy; and nothing so disciplines the mind as that which is difficult. I think the ideal method of discipline intellectually would be to give young people the things hardest for them to do, and then as soon as they begun to be easy, stop them and give them something else that was hard, so that they might presently get accustomed to the constant strain of fibre which would make anything after that easy of accomplishment. There is an old adage: “Beware of the man of one book!” By which is not meant beware of him because he is narrow, but beware of him because he knows something, and if you get in his track with regard to that thing you are going to get run over. If every man was a man of one book, of one subject, your only right strategy in life would be to feel tenderly around when you got in conversation with him until you found what his one subject of conversation was, and then avoid that. The athleticism of perfection in that one thing would make him a dangerous and ugly customer to handle.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">When you come to look over the exceedingly various fields of modern knowledge, how many elements are there? Not how many subjects—they are innumerable—but how many <render as="italic" rend="inherit">elements?</render> I do not see more than these: science (by which I mean pure science), literature, philosophy, history. Of course, in speaking of literature I include language, which is the vehicle of literature; of course, in speaking of history, I include politics, which concerns itself with many of the chief transactions of history; but, if we make the proper inclusions of these terms, what else is there besides pure science, pure philosophy, pure literature, and history and politics?</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">There are four bodies of discipline. There is the body of discipline which we call science; and inasmuch as almost all sciences have the same method and involve the same processes of observation and generalization, they can be regarded as alike in disciplinary effect. Not all of them are alike in the degree in which they discipline; but all of them are alike in the kind of discipline to which they subject the human mind.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Then there is the great body of philosophical thinking: by which I do not mean vague speculation as to the human mind, but the rational putting together of the experiences of the human mind.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">And then there is pure literature, that product of thought and of fancy and of form which springs almost (it would sometimes seem in the case of great national literatures) out of the common consciousness, where the most exquisite voices are, the voices which most perfectly express the general and common impulse, where your most authentic spokesman is the poet, who can demonstrate nothing, but who feels and perceives everything. And for the hearing of this authentic voice you must be master of its instrument, of the speech which it uses.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Then there are all the transactions of the human race which we call its history and politics.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Now, in seeking a process of enlightenment, of discipline, and of orientation amidst these great bodies of knowledge, <render as="italic" rend="inherit">how</render> are we going to seek them? It seems to me, ladies and gentlemen, that we shall never accomplish anything in our attempt at educational reorganization until we get rid of the idea which too much pervades an association, like this—the idea that our relations to each other as schoolmen and collegemen is that the one set of us are preparing youngsters for the other set of us to teach. Until we realize that the school and the college are doing the same thing exactly, we shall not get anywhere. Until we realize that, it is neither here nor there with regard to the kind of thing we are doing whether the boy or girl is going beyond the school course or going to stop at the end of it. It is only a question of how far you carry them in a process which is the same from beginning to end; and if there were any process, such as the process of certification that we were discussing this afternoon, which could make us unaware that we were crossing a bridge when we were leaving the school and entering the college; if there were some common method of life for the schoolboy and the collegeman which should make him feel less sharply than he does that when he leaves the school and enters the college he has entered a new kind of world, it would be worth while to make all the changes necessary in order to adopt it—in order to make the boy feel that he is not going from one thing to another, but that he is simply going on to prosecute a little further the fair journey upon which he had set out.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">We ought to realize that the school is not preparing the boy for the college, but that school and college are alike endeavoring, so far as time and opportunity permit, to educate the boy; and therefore it is just as important for the school to make up its mind what its method of enlightening, of discipline and of orientation is to be, as for the college.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">We are all of one family; we are all engaged upon the same thing; and we cannot do it in two ways. We must do it in one way. If we do it in two ways we shall miss connection. Therefore, it seems to me that you must set your technical training schools apart from your other schools; your technical colleges apart from your other colleges. I do not mean geographically apart from them. I think they ought to have a spiritual relationship, which is best preserved when they are in close geographical juxtaposition; but I mean that you must not confuse the aims and processes of the one with the aims and processes of the other, must not try to do two things at once with the same pupils. I am asking you to consider liberal education to-night as a task of the school as well as a task of the college.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Now, if I have been speaking the truth, what is the proper method of liberal education? I have spoken of its object, namely, enlightenment, discipline, orientation; I have spoken of its elements: pure science, pure philosophy, pure literature, history and politics. Now, what of its method? Well, in the first place, it seems to me that you must choose a particular body of studies; you must choose a particular sequence of studies; you must choose a particular systematization and relation of studies; not the same for all men, for all pupils, but some one consistent thing for each pupil. Let me illustrate. I am not going to make practical suggestions. The suggestions I am going to make are merely by way of illustration and are unpractical, because for the moment impracticable. I am simply trying to point you forward to a time which may come, but which I do not know whether we shall ever see.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Suppose that you were to make up your mind to find your liberal education in the schools in this way: to give every pupil the fundamental science; that is to say, mathematics; to give every pupil one language—let him choose any one he pleases besides Latin. It happens that Latin is the medium, so to say the background—almost the substance—of so many modern languages that it is in a sense indispensable. Let him choose one language besides the Latin—let it be Greek or let it be Spanish; it does not make any difference whether it is a modern language or an ancient language, but one language besides Latin—let him swim from first to last in the atmosphere of Latin, and then let him choose one language besides Latin. Then give up the attempt to teach English literature. You can teach English literature as a science, which it is not; or as an art, which in your hands it cannot be; but whichever way you choose to attempt to teach it you will fail, if you regard it as a thing to be objectively imparted. You cannot pedagogically impart the song of a bird; you cannot pedagogically impart the appreciation of a landscape; you cannot pedagogically impart even the nice appreciation of idioms. The only way you will ever appreciate the idiom is by hearing it often; the idiom you hear most of you will most appreciate. I judge that the modern young college man and the modern young college woman most appreciate the idiom we call slang, for I don’t hear them use anything else with gusto. The other idioms which they use they use as if they were on dress parade and knew that they were talking to a college professor. For them the only possible appreciation is the appreciation of slang, which in certain instances I very much appreciate myself. I admit that there are exigencies in one’s life when nothing else will serve.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">English, I believe, will some day come to have its proper place, both in our schools and in our colleges. It will be, what it is not to-day—the medium of all instruction. If you hold yourselves to the rule that nothing is taught by you correctly that is not taught in the best English you can command, and if you accustom the pupil to realize the fact that nothing is acceptable from him or her by way of reply that is not couched in the best English within their reach, you won’t have to teach English as a language in any other way. The only way to learn English and to appreciate it is to use it. That is the law with regard to every fact. The only way to feel its power, the only way to find its thrill communicable to you, is to get into electric connection with it by appropriating its power and making it think your thoughts, making it the vehicle of your messages from mind to mind.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I have sometimes wondered what would happen to a college class if every examination paper were rejected which did not contain correct English. There wouldn’t be any school certified then, because everybody would fail. And the excuse is, that they had to be so rapidly written; in other words, we know so little English that we need time and deliberation to use it. That is because from our childhood up we have not been brought to book and made to use it. We have been told stories in the crudest form, instead of being carried to the exquisite fountains of English in which all our older stories are to be found—instead of having been reared, from the time we were born until now, upon the sweet musical sound of a language richer than any other in cadence and sweetness, we have been given the rough phrases of the street ever since we can remember; and we cannot be taught English literature on those terms. If you ever teach English in your schools or colleges it will be because English is the atmosphere in your schools and colleges, the vehicle of their thoughts.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">And then it is perfectly possible in every school to give the pupils a sense of the movement of affairs in the world in the past and at the present time. I think the impression I got when I was a boy of history was that it was something that had happened long ago but wasn’t happening now. I certainly got the impression that almost every schoolboy gets, that <person reg="Julius Caesar" link-pointer-type="person">Cæsar’s</person> Commentaries were written for a schoolbook. If I had ever been allowed to realize the fact that this book was written by a famous general of what he did himself I think I would have sat up nights and taken notice; but none of these things were communicated to me. I was simply asked: “In what case is that noun?”</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">You will say that this is reducing education to very simple terms. Yes, very simple terms. But suppose you had a thorough grasp on the fundamental principles of mathematics; suppose that you thoroughly knew Latin and were thoroughly grounded in some one other language; suppose that you could really read the English language and love its finer forms; suppose that you had a conception of the reality of history—don’t you think you will be fairly educated? And how many of your pupils has any one of those things? I am not blaming you; you have been caught in a ridiculous system, where we are trying to teach a student everything and don’t teach him anything. When we come down to the real education of school children and undergraduates, we are going to come down to some basis like this.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">When you pass over into the college, what are you going to do? You are going to make the pupil take one science besides his mathematics, in which he is already grounded and which he will need in almost any science that he takes. Mathematics is, so to say, science relieved of the embarrassments of physical environment. It is science which is free of the trammels of time and space, and reasons about everything with its feet off the ground for the most part, so that it may reason without impediment, but which reasons with the strictest fidelity from the premises to the conclusion, and will not allow itself to leap in the process or diverge from the direct line of inference. So that it is the fundamental discipline of all scientific thinking. If your youngster really has got his mind habituated to that kind of fidelity in the treatment of his premises, then put him in some one science and give him four years of it. Let him continue the one language besides Latin whose grammar and vocabulary you grounded him in in school, and let him take that four years so that when he comes out he can read anything in that language and can speak it and write it with ease. Subject him during those four years also to the principal processes of philosophical training: logic, the main conceptions of psychology, the main items of the history of human thought, the conceptions men have had of the universe and of their relation to it, and of their own processes of thinking; and you will incidentally have done everything that I have been suggesting with regard to the school. You will have saturated him in two literatures: in the literature of the language which he is adding to Latin and in the literature of his own language, because it will be a constant medium for everything that he thinks.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">And then, at last, because in the school he has learned the reality of history and of political action, you can take him out upon the great field of the systematic study of history for four years.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Four subjects pursued for four years will have a remarkable effect upon him when he graduates. Where are we now amidst a miscellany of studies? It is said that the quantity of our entrance examinations is too great; of course it is too great; but it is not too great simply because we add a little piece here to mathematics and another over there in Latin and piece out the subjects; but because we have an enormous variety of subjects which every school is obliged to prepare its pupils in if they are going to enter college. There will be, after we have made our changes, as many subjects for the school, but not as many subjects for any one student. He will be examined (if I may recur to my illustration again) in his mathematics, in his Latin, in the one language which he has qualified to follow, and in practically nothing else; and when he comes out, he will have had enlightenment and discipline and orientation. I sympathized so deeply with <person link-pointer-type="person">Dr. Sihler</person> this morning when he said that we shall be obliged to reduce our education for each person—not for all, but for each person,—to a small body of great subjects; and until we have done that, we will not have returned to the true process of education.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Now, ladies and gentlemen, you will say: “You have attempted to deliver to us a very dogmatic and far-reaching lecture on education; and you have called it ‘School and College’.” What else could I call it? For the central idea I wish to leave with you is, that in purpose and method there is no difference between school and college. We have neglected the union and organization of forces. We have divided our learning as if we had done away with our union of States and had dissolved the federal government into a body of local principalities; and so we have neglected the very genius of our race, which is the genius of organization. The only way in which the American people have not yet shown a supreme genius in organization is that they have not yet shown a genius for simplification.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The very genius of organization is simplification. That man has not a genius for executive duty or for organization who multiplies means of action. He is the true genius who unites and simplifies; and so our real task for the immediate future is to discover the essential elements of education, whether they be those that are found catalogued here or not, and then with the utmost courage and with profound simplicity bring them together into a great <render as="italic" rend="inherit">organum</render> which we shall be able after that to use as the lasting standard of the things we are trying to do.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">We have enlarged our territories of knowledge, and we are at the same stage of mind that the Supreme Court is in: it says that <place reg="Puerto Rico" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Porto Rico</place> is foreign territory and <place reg="The Philippines" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">the Philippines</place> are not: I have forgotten whether it is that way or the other way; it doesn’t make any difference; but for some purposes they are foreign countries and for other purposes they are domestic countries, and we have not found the method of law by which to tie them unto ourselves and digest them into our political system. So with our knowledge: we have annexed territories and not known how to govern and unite them to those that are older and more established in their forms of instruction. What I plead for is, not agreement with the specific things that I have made this discourse up of, but agreement with the great thesis that I have endeavored, by all sorts of excursions and illustrations, to illustrate, namely: that we have missed the meaning of education; we have forgotten to assemble the elements of education; and we have forgotten to concentrate and simplify its methods.</p>

         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Mr. President, ladies, and gentlemen: We have witnessed in recent years an extraordinary awakening of the public conscience with regard to the methods of modern business, and of the private conscience also, for scores of business men have become conscious, as they never were before, that the eager push and ambition and competition of modern business had hurried them, oftentimes unconsciously, into practices which they had not stopped, in the heat of the struggle, to question, but which they now see to have been immoral and against the public interest. Sometimes the process of their demoralization  was very subtle, very gradual, very obscure, and therefore hidden from their consciences. Sometimes it was crude and obvious enough, but they did not stop to be careful, thinking of their rivals and not of their morals. But now the moral and political aspects of the whole matter are laid bare to their own view as well as to the view of the world, and we have run out of quiet waters into a very cyclone of reform. No man is so poor as not to have his policies for everything. The whole structure of society is being critically looked over, and changes of the most radical character are being soberly discussed, which it would take generations to perfect, but which we are hopefully thinking of putting out to contract to be finished by a specified date well within the limits of our own time.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">It is not my purpose on the present occasion to discuss particular policies and proposals. I wish, rather, to call your attention to some of the large aspects of the matter, which we should carefully consider before we make up our minds which way we should go and with what purpose we should act.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">What strikes one most forcibly in the recent agitations of public opinion is the anatomy of our present economic structure which they seem to disclose. Sharp class contrasts and divisions have been laid bare—not class distinctions in the old world or the old-time sense, but sharp distinctions of power and opportunity quite as significant. For the first time in the history of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> there is a general feeling that issue is now joined, or about to be joined, between the power of accumulated capital and the privileges and opportunities of the masses of the people. The power of accumulated capital is now, as at all other times and in all other circumstances, in the hands of a comparatively small number of persons, but there is a very widespread impression that those persons have been able in recent years as never before to control the national development in their own interest. The contest is sometimes said to be between capital and labor, but that is too narrow and too special a conception of it. It is, rather, between capital in all its larger accumulations and all other less concetrated, more dispersed, smaller, and more individual economic forces; and every new policy proposed has as its immediate or ultimate object the restraint of the power of accumulated capital for the protection and benefit of those who can not command its use.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">This anatomizing of our social structure, this pulling it to pieces and scrutinizing each part of it separately, as <sic corr="if">it</sic> it had an independent existence and interest and could live not only separately but in contrast and contest with its other parts, as if it had no organic union with them or dependence upon them, is a very dangerous and unwholesome thing at best; but there are periods of excitement and inquiry when it is inevitable, and we should make the best of it, if only to hasten the process of reintegration. This process of segregation and contrast is always a symptom of deep discontent. It is not set afoot accidentally. It generally comes about, as it has come about now, because the several parts of society have forgotten their organic connections, their vital interdependence, and have become individually selfish or hostile—because the attention of a physician is in fact necessary. It has given occasion to that extensive and radical program of reform which we call socialism and with which so many hopeful minds are now in love. We shall be able to understand our present confused affairs thoroughly and handle them wisely only when we have made clear to ourselves how this situation arose, how this program was provoked, and what we individually and collectively have to do with it.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The abstract principles of socialism it is not difficult to admire. They are, indeed, hardly distinguishable from the abstract principles of Democracy. The object of the thoughtful Socialist is to effect such an organization of society as will give the individual his best protection and his best opportunity, and yet serve the interest of all rather than the interest of any one in particular; an organization of mutual benefit based upon the principle of the solidarity of interests. But the program of socialism is another matter. It is not unfair to say that the programs of socialism so far put forth are either utterly vague or entirely impracticable. That they are now being taken very seriously and espoused very ardently is evidence, not of their excellence or practicability, but only of the fact, to which no observant man can any longer shut his eyes, that the contesting forces in our modern society have broken its unity and destroyed its organic harmony—not because that was inevitable, but because men have used their power thoughtlessly and selfishly, and legitimate undertakings have been pushed to illegitimate lengths. There has been an actual process of selfish segregation, and society has so reacted from it that almost any thoroughgoing program of reintegration looks hopeful and attractive. Such program can not be thrust aside or defeated by mere opposition and denial; they can be overcome only by wiser and better programs, and these it is our duty as patriotic citizens to find.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The most striking fact about the actual organization of modern society is that the most conspicuous, the most readily wielded, and the most formidable power is not the power of government, but the power of capital. Men of our day in <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">England</place> and <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> have almost forgotten what it is to fear the Government, but have found out what it is to fear the power of capital, to watch it with jealousy and suspicion, and trace to it the source of every open or hidden wrong. Our memories are not of history, but of what our own lives and experiences and the lives and experiences of the men about us have disclosed. We have had no experience in our day, or in the days of which our fathers have told us, of the tyranny of governments, of their minute control and arrogant interference and arbitrary regulations of our business and of our daily life, though it may be that we shall know something of it in the near future. We have forgotten what the power of government means and have found out what the power of capital means; and so we do not fear government and are not jealous of political power. We fear capital and are jealous of its domination. There will be need of many cool heads and much excellent judgment amongst us to curb this new power without throwing ourselves back into the gulf of the old, from which we were the first of the nations of the world to find a practicable way of escape.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The only forces that can save us from the one extreme or the other are those forces of social reunion and social reintegration which every man of station and character and influence in the country can in some degree and within the scope of his own life set afoot. We must open our minds wide to the new circumstances of our time, must bring about a new common understanding and effect a new coordination in the affairs which most concern us. Capital must give over its too great preoccupation with the business of making those who control it individually rich and must study to serve the interests of the people as a whole. It must draw near to the people and serve them in some intimate way of which they will be conscious. Voluntary cooperation must forestall the involuntary cooperation which legislators will otherwise seek to bring about by the coercion of law. Capital now looks to the people like a force and interest apart, with which they must deal as with a master and not as with a friend. Those who handle capital in the great industrial enterprises of the country know how mistaken this attitude is. They see how intimately the general welfare and the common interest are connected with every really sound process of business, and how all antagonisms and misunderstandings hamper and disorganize industry. But no one can now mistake the fact and no one knows better than the manipulators of capital how many circumstances there are to justify the impression. We can never excuse ourselves from the necessity of dealing with facts.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I am sure that many bankers must have become acutely and sensitively aware of the fact that the most isolated and the most criticized interest of all is banking. The banks are, in the general view and estimation, the special and exclusive instrumentalities of capital used on a large scale. They stand remote from the laborer and the body of the people, and put whatever comes into their coffers at the disposal of the big captains of industry, the great masters of finance, the corporations which are in the way to crush all competitors.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I shall not now stop to ask how far this view of the banks is true. I need not tell you that in large part it is false. I know that the close connection of the banks with the larger operations of commerce and finance is natural and not illicit, and that the banks turn very cheerfully and very cordially to the smaller pieces of business. Time was when the banks never advertised, never condescended to solicit business; now they eagerly seek it in small pieces as well as big. The banks are in fact and in spirit at the service of every man to the limit of his known trustworthiness and credit, and they know very well that there is profit in multiplying small accounts and small loans. But, on the other hand, they are in fact singularly remote from the laborer and the body of the people. They are particularly remote from the farmer and the small trader of our extensive countrysides.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Let me illustrate what I mean. Roughly speaking, every town of any size and importance in the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> has its bank. But the large majority of our people live remote from banks, are unknown to the officers who manage them, and dispense their credit. Moreover, our system of banking is such that local banks must for the most part be organized and maintained by local capital and have at their disposal only local resources. It is difficult for those of you who do not travel leisurely in the vast rural districts of this country to realize how few and far between the banks are, or how local and petty, and without extensive power to help the community most of them are when you find them. A friend of mine rode thorugh seven counties of one of the oldest of our States before finding any place where he could change a <currency type="U.S.A">$20</currency> bill; and I myself was obliged one summer, in a thriving agricultural district, to get change for bills of any considerable denomination sent to me by express from banks 50 miles distant. The business of the country was done largely by barter. I do not wonder that the men thereabout thought that the money of the country was being hoarded somewhere, presumably on Wall Street. None of it was accessible to them, though they by no means lacked in the world’s goods. They believed in the free coinage of silver, not realizing that the silver, too, would have to be handled by the banks and would be equally inaccessible. It would not have been shipped like ordinary merchandise.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">“Where and whose is the money of the country?” is the question which the average voter wants his political representative to answer for him. Bankers can answer the question, but I have met very few of them who could answer it in a way the ordinary man could understand. Bankers, as a body of experts in a particular, very responsible business, hold, and hold very clearly, certain economic facts and industrial circumstances in mind, and possess a large and unusually interesting mass of specialized knowledge of which they are masters in an extraordinary degree. But I trust you will not think me impertinent if I say that they excuse themselves from knowing a great many things which it would manifestly be to their interest to know, and that they are oftentimes singularly ignorant, or at any rate singularly indifferent, about what I may call the social functions and the political functions of banking, particularly in a country governed by opinion. I am not here to advocate the establishment of branch banks or argue in favor of anything which you understand better than I do. But I have this to say, and to say with great confidence: That if a system of branch banks, very simply and inexpensively managed and not necessarily open every day in the week, could be organized, which would put the resources of the rich banks of the country at the disposal of the whole countrysides to whose merchants and farmers only a restricted and local credit is now open, the attitude of plain men everywhere toward the banks and banking would be changed utterly within less than a generation. You know that you are looking out for investments; that even the colossal enterprises of our time do not supply you with safe investments enough for the money that comes in to you; and that banks here, there, and everywhere are tempted, as a consequence, to place money in speculative enterprises, and even themselves to promote questionable ventures in finance at a fearful and wholly unjustifiable risk in order to get the usury they wish from their resources. You sit only where these things are spoken of and big returns coveted. There would be plenty of investments if you carried your money to the people of the country at large and had agents in hundreds of villages who knew the men in their neighborhoods who could be trusted with loans and who would make profitable use of them. Your money, moreover, would quicken and fertilize the country, and that other result would follow which I think you will agree with me is not least important in my argument: The average voter would learn that the money of the country was not being hoarded; that it was at the disposal of any honest man who could use it; and that to strike at the banks was to strike at the general convenience and general prosperity. I do not know what the arguments against branch banks are; but these I know from observation to be the arguments for them, and very weighty arguments they seem to me to be.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">That, however, need not concern me. I am not so much interested in argument as in illustration. My theme is this: Bankers, like men of every other interest, have their lot and part in the Nation—their social function and their political duty. We have come upon a time of crisis when it is made to appear, and is in part true, that interest is arrayed against interest; and it is our duty to turn war into peace. It is the duty of the banker, as it is the duty of men of every other class, to see to it that there be in his calling no class spirit, no feeling of antagonism to the people, to plain men whom the bankers to their great loss and detriment, do not know. It is their duty to be intelligent, thoughtful, patriotic intermediaries between capital and the people at large; to understand and serve the general interest; to be public men serving the country as well as private men serving their depositors and the enterprises whose securities and notes they hold. How capital is to draw near to the people and serve them at once obviously and safely is the question, the great and now pressing question, which it is the particular duty of the banker to answer. No one else can answer it so intelligently; and if he does not answer it others will, it may be, to his detriment and to the general embarrassment of the country. The occasion and the responsibility are yours.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">We live in a very interesting time of awakening, in a period of reconstruction and readjustment, when everything is being questioned and even old foundations are threatened with change. But it is not a time of danger if we do not lose our heads and ignore our consciences. It is, on the contrary, a time of extraordinary privilege and opportunity when men of every class have begun to think upon the themes of the public welfare as they never thought before. I feel that I have only to speak of your social duty and political function to meet with a very instant and effectual response out of your own thoughts and purposes. I think you will agree with me that our responsibility in a democratic country is not only for what we do and for the way and spirit in which we do it, but also for the impression we make. We are bound to make the right impression and to contribute by our action not only to the general prosperity and well-being of the country, but also to its general instruction, so that men of different classes can understand each other, can serve each other with intelligence and energy. There is  a sense in which a democratic country statesmanship is forced upon every man of initiative, every man capable of leading anybody; and this I believe to be the particular period when statesmanship is forced upon bankers and upon all those who have to do with the application and use of the vast accumulated wealth of this country. We should, for example, not only seek the best solution for our currency difficulties, not only the safest  and most scientific system of elastic currency to meet the convenience of a country in which the amount of cash needed at different times fluctuates enormously and violently, but we should also seek to give the discussions of such matters such publicity and such general currency and such simplicity as will enable men of every kind and calling to understand what we are talking about and take an intelligent part in the discussion. We can not shut ourselves in as experts to our own business. We must open our thoughts to the country at large and serve the general intelligence as well as the general welfare.</p>

         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen, the thought that
            entered my mind first as I came into this great room this evening
            framed itself in a question, Why should this great body of people
            have come together upon this solemn night? There is nothing here to
            be seen. There is nothing delectable here to be heard. Why should
            you run together in a great host when all that is to be spoken of is
            the history of a familiar book?</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">But as I have sat and looked upon this great body of
            people I have thought of the very suitable circumstance that here
            upon the platform sat a little group of ministers of the gospel lost
            in this great throng.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I say the “suitable circumstance,” for I come here to
            night to speak of the Bible as the book of the people, not the book
            of the minister of the gospel, not the special book of the priest
            from which to set forth some occult, unknown doctrine withheld from
            the common understanding of men, but a great book of revelation—the
            people’s book of revelation. For it seems to me that the Bible has
            revealed the people to themselves. I wonder how many persons in this
            great audience realize the significance for English-speaking peoples
            of the translation of the Bible into the English tongue. Up to the
            time of the translation of the Bible into English, it was a book for
            long ages withheld from the perusal of the peoples of other
            languages and of other tongues, and not a little of the history of
            liberty lies in the circumstance that the moving sentences of this
            book were made familiar to the ears and the understanding of those
            peoples who have led mankind in exhibiting the forms of government
            and the impulses of reform which have made for freedom and for
            self-government among mankind.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">For this is a book which reveals men unto themselves,
            not as creatures in bondage, not as men under human authority, not
            as those bidden to take counsel and command of any human source. It
            reveals every man to himself as a distinct moral agent, responsible
            not to men, not even to those men whom he has put over him in
            authority, but responsible through his own conscience to his Lord
            and Maker. Whenever a man sees this vision he stands up a free man,
            whatever may be the government under which he lives, if he sees
            beyond the circumstances of his own life.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I heard a very eloquent sermon to-day from an honored
            gentleman who is with us to-night. He was speaking upon the effect
            of a knowledge of the future life upon our conduct in this life. And
            it seemed to me that as I listened to him I saw the flames of those
            fires rekindled at which the martyrs died—died forgetful of their
            pain, with praise and thanksgiving upon their lips, that they had
            the opportunity to render their <sic corr="testimony">testimoney</sic> that this was not the life for which they had
            lived, but that there was a house builded in the heavens, not built
            of men, but built of God, to the vision of which they had lifted
            their eyes as they passed through the world, which gave them courage
            to fear no man, but to serve God. And I thought that all the records
            of heroism, of the great things that had illustrated human life,
            were summed up in the power of men to see that vision.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Our present life, ladies and gentlemen, is a very
            imperfect and disappointing thing. We do not judge our own conduct
            in the privacy of our own closets by the standard of expediency by
            which we are daily and hourly governed. We know that there is a
            standard set for us in the heavens, a standard revealed to us in
            this book which is the fixed and eternal standard by which we judge
            ourselves, and as we read this book it seems to us that the pages of
            our own hearts are laid open before us for our own perusal. This is
            the people’s book of revelation, revelation of themselves not alone,
            but revelation of life and of peace. You know that human life is a
            constant struggle. For a man who has lost the sense of struggle life
            has ceased.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I believe that my confidence in the judgment of the
            people in matters political is based upon my knowledge that the men
            who are struggling are the men who know; that the men who are in the
            midst of the great effort to keep themselves steady in the pressure
            and rush of life are the men who know the significance of the
            pressure and the rush of life, and that they, the men on the make,
            are the men to whom to go for your judgments of what life is and
            what its problems are. And in this book there is peace simply
            because we read here the object of the struggle. No man is satisfied
            with himself as the object of the struggle.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">There is a very interesting phrase that constantly
            comes to our lips which we perhaps do not often enough interpret in
            its true meaning. We see many a young man start out in life with
            apparently only this object in view—to make name and fame and power
            for himself, and there comes a time of maturity and reflection when
            we say of him, “He has come to himself.” When may I say that I have
            come to myself? Only when I have come to recognize my true relations
            with the rest of the world. We speak of a man losing himself in a
            desert. If you reflect a moment you will see that is the only thing
            he has not lost. He himself is there. What he means when he says
            that he has lost himself is that he has lost all the rest of the
            world. He has nothing to steer by. He does not know where any human
            habitation lies. He does not know where any beaten path and highway
            is. If he could establish his relationship with anything else in the
            world he would have found himself. Let it serve as a picture.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">A man has found himself when he has found his relation
            to the rest of the universe, and here is the book in which those
            relations are set forth. And so when you see a man going along the
            highways of life with his gaze lifted above the road, lifted to the
            sloping ways in front of him, then be careful of that man and get
            out of his way. He knows the kingdom for which he is bound. He has
            seen the revelation of himself and of his relations to mankind. He
            has seen the revelations of his relation to God and his Maker, and
            therefore he has seen his responsibility in the world. This is the
            revelation of life and of peace. I do not know that peace lies in
            constant accommodation. I was once asked if I would take part in a
            great peace conference, and I said, “Yes; if I may speak in favor of
            war”—not the war which we seek to avoid, not the senseless and
            useless and passionate shedding of human blood, but the only war
            that brings peace, the war with human passions and the war with
            human wrong—the war which is that untiring and unending process of
            reform from which no man can refrain and get peace.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">No man can sit down and withhold his hands from the
            warfare against wrong and get peace out of his acquiescence. The
            most solid and satisfying peace is that which comes from this
            constant spiritual warfare, and there are times in the history of
            nations when they must take up the crude instruments of bloodshed in
            order to vindicate spiritual conceptions. For liberty is a spiritual
            conception, and when men take up arms to set other men free, there
            is something sacred and holy in the warfare. I will not cry “peace”
            so long as there is sin and wrong in the world. And this great book
            does not teach any doctrine of peace so long as there is sin to be
            combated and overcome in one’s own heart and in the great moving
            force of human society.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">And so it seems to me that we must look upon the <name type="title">Bible</name> as the great charter of the human
            soul—as the “Magna Charta” of the human soul. You know the
            interesting circumstances which gave rise to the Magna Charta. You
            know the moving scene that was enacted upon the heath at
               <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Runnymede</place>. You know how the barons of
               <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">England</place>, representing the people of
            <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">England</place>—for they consciously represented the people
            of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">England</place>—met upon that historic spot and parleyed
            with <person link-pointer-type="person">John</person>, the King. They said, “We will come to
            terms with you here.” They said, “There are certain inalienable
            rights of English-speaking men which you must observe. They are not
            given by you, they can not be taken away by you. Sign your name here
            to this parchment upon which these rights are written and we are
            your subjects. Refuse to put your name to this document and we are
            your sworn enemies. Here are our swords to prove it.”</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The franchise of human liberty made the basis of a
            bargain with a king. There are kings upon the pages of Scripture,
            but do you think of any king in Scripture as anything else than a
            mere man? There was the great <person link-pointer-type="person">King David</person>, of a line
            blessed because the line from which should spring our Lord and
            Savior, a man marked in the history of mankind as the chosen
            instrument of God to do justice and exalt righteousness in the
            people.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">But what does this Bible do for
            <person link-pointer-type="person">David</person>? Does it utter eulogies upon him? Does it
            conceal his faults and magnify his virtues? Does it set him up as a
            great statesman would be set up in a modern biography? No; the book
            in which his annals are written strips the mask from
            <person link-pointer-type="person">David</person>, strips every shred of counterfeit and
            concealment from him and shows him as indeed an instrument of God,
            but a sinful and selfish man, and the verdict of the Bible is that
               <person link-pointer-type="person">David</person>, like other men, was one day to stand
            naked before the judgment seat of God and be judged not as a king
            but as a man. Is not this the book of the people? Is there any man
            in this Holy Scripture who is exempted from the common standard and
            judgment? How these pages teem with the masses of mankind. Are these
            the annals of the great? These are the annals of the people—of the
            common run of men.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The New Testament is the history of the life and the
            testimony of common men who rallied to the fellowship of
               <person link-pointer-type="person">Jesus Christ</person> and who by their faith and
            preaching remade a world that was under the thrall of the Roman
            army. This is the history of the triumph of the human spirit, in the
            persons of humble men. And how many sorts of men march across the
            pages, how infinite is the variety of human circumstance and of
            human dealings and of human heroism and love! Is this a picture of
            extraordinary things? This is a picture of the common life of
            mankind. It is a mirror held up for men’s hearts, and it is in this
            mirror that we marvel to see ourselves portrayed.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">How like to the Scripture is all great literature!
            What is it that entrances us when we read or witness a play of
               <person reg="William Shakespeare" link-pointer-type="person">Shakespeare</person>? It is the
            consciousness that this man, this all-observing mind, saw men of
            every cast and kind as they were in their habits, as they lived. And
            as passage succeeds passage we seem to see the characters of
            ourselves and our friends portrayed by this ancient writer, and a
            play of <person reg="William Shakespeare" link-pointer-type="person">Shakespeare</person> is
            just as modern to-day as upon the day it was penned and first
            enacted. And the Bible is without age or date or time. It is a
            picture of the human heart displayed for all ages and for all sorts
            and conditions of men. Moreover, the Bible does what is so
            invaluable in human life—it classifies moral values. It apprises us
            that men are not judged according to their wits, but according to
            their characters—that the last of every man’s reputation is his
            truthfulness, his squaring his conduct with the standards that he
            knew to be the standards of purity and rectitude.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">How many a man we appraise, ladies and gentlemen, as
            great to-day whom we do not admire as noble! A man may have great
            power and small character. And the sweet praise of mankind lies not
            in their admiration of the smartness with which the thing was
            accomplished, but in that lingering love which apprises men that one
            of their fellows has gone out of life to his own reckoning, where he
            is sure of the blessed verdict, “Well done, good and faithful
            servant.”</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Did you ever look about you in any great city, in any
            great capital, at the statues which have been erected in it? To whom
            are these statues erected? Are they erected to the men who have
            piled fortunes about them? I do not know of any such statue
            anywhere, unless after he had accumulated his fortune the man
            bestowed it in beneficence upon his fellow men, and alongside of him
            will stand a statue of another meaning, for it is easy to give money
            away. I heard a friend of mine say that the standard of generosity
            was not the amount you gave away, but the amount you had left. It is
            easy to give away of your abundance; but look at the next statue,
            the next statue, and the next in the market place of great cities,
            and whom will you see? You will see here a soldier who gave his life
            to serve, not his own ends, but the interests and the purposes of
            his country.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I would be the last, ladies and gentlemen, to
            disparage any of the ordinary occupations of life, but I want to ask
            you this question: Did you ever see anybody who had lost a son hang
            up his yardstick over the mantelpiece? Have you not seen many
            families who had lost their sons hang up their muskets and their
            swords over the mantelpiece? What is the difference between the
            yardstick and the musket? There is nothing but perfect honor in the
            use of the yardstick, but the yardstick was used for the man’s own
            interest, for his own self-support. It was used merely to fulfill
            the necessary exigencies of life, whereas the musket was used to
            serve no possible purpose of his own. He took every risk without any
            possibility of profit. The musket is the symbol of self-sacrifice
            and the yardstick is not. A man will instinctively elevate the one
            as the symbol of honor and never dream of using the other as a
            symbol of distinction.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Doesn’t that cut pretty deep, and don’t you know why
            the soldier has his monument as against the civilian’s? The civilian
            may have served his State—he also—and here and there you may see a
            statesman’s statue, but the civilian has generally served his
            country—has often served his country, at any rate—with some idea of
            promoting his own interests, whereas the soldier has everything to
            lose and nothing but the gratitude of his fellow men to win.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Let every man pray that he may in some true sense be a
            soldier of fortune, that he may have the good fortune to spend his
            energies and his life in the service of his fellow men in order that
            he may die to be recorded upon the rolls of those who have not
            thought of themselves but have thought of those whom they served.
            Isn’t this the lesson of our Lord and Savior <person link-pointer-type="person">Jesus
            Christ</person>? Am I not reminding you of these common judgments of
            our life, simply expounding to you this book of revelation, this
            book which reveals the common man to himself, which strips life of
            its disguises and its pretenses and elevates those standards by
            which alone true greatness and true strength and true valor are
            assessed?</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Do you wonder, therefore, that when I was asked what
            my theme this evening would be I said it would be “The Bible and
            Progress”? We do not judge progress by material standards.
               <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> is not ahead of the other nations of the
            world because she is rich. Nothing makes <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place>
            great except her thoughts, except her ideals, except her acceptance
            of those standards of judgment which are written large upon these
            pages of revelation. <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> has all along claimed
            the distinction of setting this example to the civilized world—that
            men were to think of one another, that governments were to be set up
            for the service of the people, that men were to be judged by these
            moral standards which pay no regard to rank or birth or conditions,
            but which assess every man according to his single and individual
            value. This is the meaning of this charter of the human soul. This
            is the standard by which men and nations have more and more come to
            be judged. And so the form has consisted in nothing more nor less
            than this—in trying to conform actual conditions, in trying to
            square actual laws with the right judgments of human conduct and
            more than liberty.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">That is the reason that the Bible has stood at the
            back of progress. That is the reason that reform has come not from
            the top but from the bottom. If you are ever tempted to let a
            government reform itself, I ask you to look back in the pages of
            history and find me a government that reformed itself. If you are
            ever tempted to let a party attempt to reform itself, I ask you to
            find a party that ever reformed itself.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">A tree is not nourished by its bloom and by its fruit.
            It is nourished by its roots, which are down deep in the common and
            hidden soil, and every process of purification and rectification
            comes from the bottom—not from the top. It comes from the masses of
            struggling human beings. It comes from the instinctive efforts of
            millions of human hearts trying to beat their way up into the light
            and into the hope of the future.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Parties are reformed and governments are corrected by
            the impulses coming out of the hearts of those who never exercised
            authority and never organized parties. Those are the sources of
            strength, and I pray God that these sources may never cease to be
            spiritualized by the immortal subjections of these words of
            inspiration of the Bible.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">If any statesman sunk in the practices which debase a
            nation will but read this single book, he will go to his prayers
            abashed. Do you not realize, ladies and gentlemen, that there is a
            whole literature in the Bible? It is not one book, but a score of
            books. Do you realize what literature is? I am sometimes sorry to
            see the great classics of our English literature used in the schools
            as textbooks, because I am afraid that little children may gain the
            impression that these are formal lessons to be learned. There is no
            great book in any language, ladies and gentlemen, that is not the
            spontaneous outpouring of some great mind on the cry of some great
            heart. And the reason that poetry moves us more than prose does is
            that it is the rhythmic and passionate voice of some great spirit
            that has seen more than his fellow men can see.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I have found more true politics in the poets of the
            English-speaking race than I have ever found in all the formal
            treatises on political science. There is more of the spirit of our
            own institutions in a few lines of <person refurl="x4003615" reg="Alfred Tennyson" link-pointer-type="person">Tennyson</person> than in
            all the textbooks on governments put together:</p>

         </p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Can you find summed up the manly, self-helping spirit
            of Saxon liberty anywhere better than in those few lines? Men afraid
            of nobody, afraid of nothing but their own passions, on guard
            against being caught unaware by their own sudden impulses and so
            getting their grapple upon life in firm-set institutions, some
            reverence for the laws themselves have made, some patience, not
            passionate force, to change them when they will, some civic manhood
            firm against the crowd. Literature, ladies and gentlemen, is
            revelation of the human spirit, and within the covers of this one
            book is a whole lot of literature, prose and poetry, history and
            rhapsody, the sober narration of the ecstacy of human
            excitement—things that ring in one’s ears like songs never to be
            forgotten. And so I say let us never forget that these deep sources,
            these wells of inspiration, must always be our sources of
            refreshment and of renewal. Then no man can put unjust power upon
            us. We shall live in that chartered liberty in which a man sees the
            things unseen, in which he knows that he is bound for a country in
            which there are no questions mooted any longer of right or wrong.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Can you imagine a man who did not believe these words,
            who did not believe in the future life, standing up and doing what
            has been the heart and center of liberty always—standing up before
            the king himself and saying, “Sir, you have sinned and done wrong in
            the sight of God, and I am His messenger of judgment to pronounce
            upon you the condemnation of Almighty God. You may silence me, you
            may send me to my reckoning with my Maker, but you can not silence
            or reverse the judgment.” That is what a man feels whose faith is
            rooted in the Bible. And the man whose faith is rooted in the Bible
            knows that reform can not be stayed, that the finger of God that
            moves upon the face of the nations is against every man that plots
            the nation’s downfall or the people’s deceit; that these men are
            simply groping and staggering in their ignorance to a fearful day of
            judgment; and that whether one generation witnesses it or not the
            glad day of revelation and of freedom will come in which men will
            sing by the host of the coming of the Lord in His glory, and all of
            those will be forgotten—those little, scheming, contemptible
            creatures that forgot the image of God and tried to frame men
            according to the image of the evil one.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">You may remember that allegorical narrative in the Old
            Testament of those who searched through one cavern after another
            cutting the holes in the walls and going into the secret places
            where all sorts of noisome things were worshipped. Men do not dare
            to let the sun shine in upon such things and upon such occupations
            and worships. And so I say there will be no halt to the great
            movement of the armies of reform until men forget their God, until
            they forget this charter of their liberty. Let no man suppose that
            progress can be divorced from religion or that there is any other
            platform for the ministers of reform than the platform written in
            the utterances of our Lord and Savior.</p>

         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Mr. President, Ladies, and Gentlemen: The lawyer is, by very definition, an expert in the law; and society lives by law. Without it its life is vague, inchoate, disordered, vexed with a hopeless instability. At every turn of its experience society tries to express its life, therefore, in law—to make the rules of its action universal and imperative. This is the whole process of politics. Politics is the struggle for law, for an institutional expression of the changing life of society.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Of course, this is the deeper view of politics. It is not the view of the mere party man or of the professional politician. He thinks chiefly, no doubt, of the offices and their emoluments; of the tenure of power; of the choice of policy from day to day in the administration of the various departments of government; of the hundred advantages, both personal and partisan, which can be obtained in a successful contest for the control of the instruments of politics; but even he can not escape the deeper view at last. He must express the policy of his party or the advantage gained by his occupation of office in statutes, in rules of law, imposed in the interest of some class or group, if not in the interest of society at large. He is really, in the last analysis, struggling to control law and the development and use of institutions. He needs as much as the statesman does the assistance of the legal expert, the skill of the technical guide; the lawyer must be at his elbow to see that he plays the game according to the nominal rules.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The lawyer, therefore, has always been indispensable, whether he merely guided the leaders or was himself the leader, and nowhere has the lawyer played a more prominent part in politics than in England and America, where the rules of law have always been the chief instruments of contest and regulation, of liberty and efficient organization, and the chief means of lifting society from one stage to the next of its slow development.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The lawyer’s ideal part in this unending struggle is easy to conceive. There is long experience stored up in the history of law. He, above all other men, should have a quick perception of what is feasible, of the new things that will fit into the old, of the experiences which should be heeded, the wrongs that should be remedied, and the rights that should be more completely realized. He knows out of his own practice how pitiful, oftentimes, against how many obstacles, amidst how many impediments, often interposed by the law itself, sometimes interposed by the ignorance of society or by the malevolence of designing men, the men about him make their daily effort to live free from the unnecessary interference or the selfish stupidity or the organized opposition of their neighbors and rivals. He knows what forces gather and work their will in the field of industry, of commerce, of all enterprise. He, if any man, knows where justice breaks down, where law needs amplification or amendment or radical change, what the alterations are that must be effected before the right will come into action easily and certainly and with genuine energy. He should at every turn be the mediator between groups of men, between all contending and contesting interests. He should show how differences are to be moderated, and antagonisms adjusted and society given peace and ease of movement.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">He can play this ideal part, however, only if he has the right insight and sympathy. If he regards his practice as a mere means of livelihood, if he is satisfied to put his expert advice at the service of any interest or enterprise, if he does not regard himself as an officer of the State, but only as an agent of private interest, if, above all, he does not really see the wrongs that are accumulating, the mischief that is being wrought, the hearts that are being broken and the lives that are being wrecked, the hopes that are being snuffed out and the energies that are being sapped, he can not play the part of guide or moderator or adviser in the large sense that will make him a statesman and a benefactor.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">It is a hard thing to exact of him, no doubt, that he should have a nonprofessional attitude toward law, that he should be more constantly conscious of his duties as a citizen than of his interests as a practitioner, but nothing less than that will fit him to play the really great rôle intended for his profession in the great  plot of affairs. He must breed himself in the true philosophy of his calling. It is his duty to see from the point of view of all sorts and conditions of men, of the men whom he is not directly serving as well as of those whom he is directly serving.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">This is a matter of character, of disposition, and of training outside the schools of law, in the broader schools of duty and of citizenship and of patriotism. It is a great conception when once a lawyer has filled himself with it. It lifts him oftentimes to a very high place of vision and of inspiration. It makes of him the custodian of the honor and integrity of a great social order, an instrument of humanity, because an instrument of justice and fair dealing and of all those right adjustments of life that make the world fit to live in.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">If I contrast with this ideal conception of the function of the lawyer in society what I may be excused for calling his actual rôle in the struggle for law and progress and the renovation of affairs, I hope that I will not be interpreted as suggesting a view of our great profession which is in any wise touched with cynicism or even with the spirit of harsh criticism. The facts do not justify a cynical view of the profession or even a fear that it may be permanently losing the spirit which has ruled the action of the greater members of the bar and of the immortal judges who have presided at the birth and given strength and fiber to the growth and liberty and human right. I wish to submit what I have to say in all fairness and without color even of discouragement.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The truth is that the technical training of the modern American lawyer, his professional prepossessions and his business involvements, impose limitations upon him and subject him to temptations which seriously stand in the way of his rendering the ideal service to society which is demanded by the true standards and canons of his profession. Modern business, in particular, with its huge and complicated processes, has tended to subordinate him, to make of him a servant, an instrument instead of a free adviser and a master of justice. My professional life has afforded me a rather close view of the training of the modern lawyer in schools, and I must say that it seems to me an intensely technical training. Even the greater and broader principles of which the elder lawyers used to discourse with a touch of broad philosophy, those principles which used to afford writers like Blackstone occasion for incidental disquisitions on the character and history of society, now wear in our teaching so technical an aspect, are seen through the medium of so many wire-drawn decisions, are covered with so thick a gloss of explanation and ingenious interpretation, that they do not wear an open and genial and human aspect, but seem to belong to some recondite and private science.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Moreover, the prepossessions of the modern lawyer are all in favor of his close identification with his clients. The lawyer deems himself in conscience bound to be contentious, to manuever for every advantage, to contribute to his clients’ benefit his skill in a difficult and hazardous game. He seldom thinks of himself as the advocate of society. His very feeling that he is the advocate now of this, now of that, and again of another special individual interest separates him from broader conceptions. He moves in the atmosphere of private rather than public service. Moreover, he is absorbed now more than ever before into the great industrial organism. His business becomes more and more complicated and specialized. His studies and his services are apt to become more and more confined to some special field of law. He grows more and more a mere expert in the legal side of a certain class of great industrial or financial undertakings. The newspapers and the public in general speak of “corporation lawyers,” and of course the most lucrative business of our time is derived from the need that the great business combinations we call corporations have at every turn of their affairs of an expert legal adviser. It is apt to happen with the most successful, and by that test the most eminent, lawyers of our American communities that by the time they reach middle life their thoughts have become fixed in very hard and definite molds. Though they have thought honestly, they are apt to have thought narrowly; they have not made themselves men of wide sympathies or discernment.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">It is evident what must happen in such circumstances. The bench must be filled from the bar, and it is growing increasingly difficult to supply the bench with disinterested, unspoiled lawyers, capable of being the free instruments of society, the friends and guides of statesmen, the interpreters of the common life of the people, the mediators of the great process by which justice is led from one enlightenment and liberalization to another.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">For the notable, I had almost said fundamental, circumstance of our political life is that our courts are, under our constitutional system, the means of our political development. Every change in our law, every modification of political practice, must sooner or later pass under their scrutiny. We can go only as fast as the legal habit of mind of our lawyers will permit. Our politics are bound up in the mental character and attitude and is so intensely and characteristically a legal polity that our politics depend upon our lawyers. They are the ultimate instruments of our life.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">There are two present and immediate tests of the serviceability of the legal profesion to the Nation, which I think will at once be recognized as tests which it is fair to apply. In the first place, there is the cirtical matter of reform of legal procedure—the almost invariable theme, if I am not mistaken, of all speakers upon this question from the President of the United States down. America lags far behind other countries in the essential matter of putting the whole emphasis in our courts upon the substance of right and justice. If the bar associations of this country were to devote themselves, with the great knowledge and ability at their command, to the utter simplification of judicial procedure, to the abolition of technical difficulties and pitfalls, to the removal of every unnecessary form, to the absolute  subordination of method to the object sought, they would do a great patriotic service, which, if they will not address themselves to it, must be undertaken by laymen and novices. The actual miscarriages of justice, because of nothing more than a mere slip in a phrase or a mere error in an immaterial form, are nothing less than shocking. Their number is incalculable, but much more incalculable than their number is the damage they do to the reputation of the profession and to the majesty and integrity of the law. Any one bar association which would show the way to radical reform in these matters would insure a universal reconsideration of the matter from one end of the country to the other and would by that means redeem the reputation of a great profession and set American society forward a whole generation in its struggle for an equitable adjustment of its difficulties.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The second and more fundamental immediate test of the profession is its attitude toward the regulation of modern business, particularly of the powers and action of modern corporations. It is absoutely necessary that society should command its instruments and not be dominated by them. The lawyer, not the layman, has the best accesss to the means by which the reforms of our economic life can be best and most fairly accomplished. Never before in our history did those who guide affairs more seriously need the assistance of those who can claim an expert familiarity with the legal processes by which reforms may be effectually accomplished. It is in this matter more than any other that our profession may now be said to be on trial. It will gain or lose the confidence of the country as it proves equal to the test or unequal.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">As one looks about him at the infinite complexities of the modern problems of life, at the great tasks to be accomplished by law, at the issues of life and happiness and prosperity involved, one can not but realize how much depends upon the part the lawyer is to play in the future politics of the country. If he will not assume the rôle of patriot and of statesman, if he will not lend all his learning to the service of the common life of the country, if he will not open his sympathies to common men and enlist his enthusiasm in those policies which will bring regeneration to the business of the country, less expert hands than his must attempt the difficult and perilous business. It will be clumsily done. It will be done at the risk of reaction against the law itself. It will be done perhaps with brutal disregard of the niceties of justice, with clumsiness instead of with skill.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The tendencies of the profession, therefore, its sympathies, its inclination, its prepossessions, its training, its point of view, its <sic corr="motives">motves</sic>, are part of the stuff and substance of the destiny of the country. It is these matters rather than any others that bar associations should consider; for an association is greater than the individual lawyer. It should embody not the individual ambition of the practitioner, but the point of view of society with regard to the profession. It should hold the corporate conscience and consciousness of the profession. It is inspiring to think what might happen if but one great State bar association were to make up its mind and move toward these great objects with intelligence, determination, and indomitable perseverance.</p>

         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Mr. Chairman and gentlemen, the object of this meeting is not agitation, it is the statement of a plain case in such terms as may serve to arrest the attention of the Nation with regard to a matter which is of no mere local importance, which does not merely affect the rights and essential privileges of our Jewish fellow citizens as freemen and Americans, but which touches the dignity of our Government and the maintenance of those rights of manhood which that Government was set up to vindicate.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The facts are these: For some 80 years a treaty has existed between this country and <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Russia</place> in which it explicitly covenanted and agreed that the inhabitants of the two nations shall have the liberty of entering any part of the territory of either that is open to foreign commerce; that they shall be at liberty to sojourn and reside in all parts whatsoever of the territory thus opened to commerce, in order to attend to their affairs; and that they shall enjoy the same security and protection as inhabitants of the country in which they are sojourning, on condition, of course, that they submit to the laws and ordinances there prevailing, and particularly to the regulations there in force concerning commerce. For some 40 years the obligations of this treaty have been disregarded by <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Russia</place> in respect of our Jewish fellow citizens. Our Government has protested, but has never gone protest. After 40 years of more correspondence the Russian Government naturally does not expect the matter to be carried beyond protest to action, and so continues to act as it pleases in this matter, in the confidence that our Government does not seriously mean to include our Jewish fellow citizens among those upon whose rights it will insist.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">It is not necessary to conjecture the reasons. The treaty thus disregarded by <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Russia</place> is a treaty of commerce and navigation. Its main object is trade, the sort of economic intercourse between the two nations that will promote the material interests of both. Important commercial and industrial relations have been established under it. Large American undertakings, we are informed, would be put in serious peril were those relations broken off. We must concede something, even at the expense of a certain number of our fellow citizens in order not to risk a loss greater than the object which would seem to justify.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I for one do not fear any loss. The economic relations of two great nations are not based upon sentiment; they are based upon interest. It is safe to say that in this instance they are not based upon mutual respect, for <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Russia</place> can not respect us when she sees us for 40 years together preferring our interests to our rights. Whatever our feeling may be with regard to <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Russia</place>, whatever our respect for her statesmen or our sympathy with the great future in store for her people, she would certainly be justified in acting upon the expectation that we would follow our calculations of expediency rather than our convictions of right and justice. Only once or twice, it would seem, has she ever thought our Government in earnest. Should she ever deem it in earnest, respect would take the place of covert indifference and the treaty would be lived up to. If it was ever advantageous to her, it is doubly and trebly advantageous now, and her advantage would be her guide, as has been ours, in the maintenance of a treaty of trade and navigation.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">If the Russian Government has felt through all these years that it could ignore the protest of American ministers and Secretaries of State, it has been because the American Government spoke for special interests or from some special point of view and not for the American people. It is the fact that the attention of the American people has now been drawn to this matter that is altering the whole aspect of it.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">We are a practical people. Like the rest of the world we establish our trade relations upon grounds of interest, not sentiment. The feeling of the American people toward the people of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Russia</place> has always been one of deep sympathy, and I believe of ready comprehension, and we have dealt with their Government in frankness and honor, wherever it appears that the interests of both nations could be served. We have not held off from cordial intercourse or withheld our respect because her political policy was so sharply contrasted with ours. Our desire is to be her friend and to make our relations with her closer and closer.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">But there lies a principle back of our life. <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> is not a mere body of traders; it is a body of free men. Our greatness is built upon our freedom—is moral, not material. We have a great ardor for gain; but we have a deep passion for the rights of man. Principles lie back of our action. <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> would be inconceivable without them. These principles are not incompatible with  great material prosperity. On the contrary, unless we are deeply mistaken, they are indispensable to it. We are not willing to have prosperity, however, if our fellow citizens must suffer contempt for it, or lose the rights that belong to every American in order that we may enjoy it. The price is too great.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Here is a great body of our Jewish fellow citizens, from whom have sprung men of genius in every walk of our varied life, men who have become part of the very stuff of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place>, who have conceived its ideals with singular clearness and led its enterprise with spirit and sagacity. They are playing a particularly conspicuous part in building up of the very prosperity which our Government has so great a stake in its dealings with the Russian Government with regard to the rights of men. They are not Jews in <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place>; they are American citizens. In this great matter with which we deal <word altform="tonight">to-night</word>, we speak for them as for representatives and champions of principles which underlie the very structure of our Government. They have suddenly become representatives of us all. By our action for them shall be tested our sincerity, our genuineness, the reality of principle among us.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I am glad this question has been thus brought into the open. There is here a greater stake than any other upon which we could set our hearts. Here is the final test of our ability to square our policies with our principles. We may now enjoy the exhilaration of matching our professions with handsome performance. We are not here to express our sympathy with our Jewish fellow citizens, but to make evident our sense of identity with them. This is not their cause; it is America’s. It is the cause of all who love justice and do right.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The means by which the wrongs we compain of may be set right are plain. There is no hostility in what we do toward the Russian Government. No man who takes counsel of principle will have in his thought anything but purposes of peace. There need be for us in this great matter no touch of anger. But the conquests of peace are based upon mutual respect. The plain fact of the matter is that for some 40 years we have observed the obligations of our treaty with <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Russia</place> and she has not. That can go on no longer. So soon as <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Russia</place> fully understands that it can go on no longer, that we must, with whatever regret, break off the intercourse between our people and our merchants, unless the agreements upon which it is is based can be observed in letter and in spirit, the air will clear. There is every reason why our intercourse should be maintained and extended, but it can not be upon such terms as at present. If the explicit provisions of our present agreement can not be maintained, we must reconsider the matter in the light of the altered circumstances and see upon what terms, if any, of mutual honor our intercourse may be reestablished. We have advantages to offer her merchants, her mine owners, her manufacturers, which her Government will not despise. We are not suppliants. We come with gifts in our hands. Her statesmen see as clearly as ours. An intolerable situation will be remedied just as soon as <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Russia</place> is convinced that for us it is indeed intolerable.</p>

         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">It is with real pleasure that I find myself here again and realize as I look about me that these are familiar surroundings, for it has always been with unfailing cordiality that you have welcomed me, and I have always had the feeling that this was a place where it was worth while to say something, if one had anything to say.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I want to begin by congratulating the club upon the program of action which it has formed under the leadership of its intelligent officers. It is very delightful that a club should see at the outset of a campaign just the most effectual way of conducting that campaign. A campaign can be conducted only by the intelligent and earnest co-operation of men. There is a singular difference, into the psychology of which I will not try to enter, between a campaign for tariff reform initiated by a professedly reform society and a campaign for tariff reform initiated by a professedly political association, for a political organization is known to exist in order to transact business. It does not exist merely for the purpose of discussing abstract ideas. You realize that when a club like this argues about tariff reform, that’s the basis of a constructive program, not merely the basis of exposition. You are not merely going to send lecturers around the country, but are going to debate the affairs of the nation with the idea of getting a sufficient number of fellow citizens to stand with you; for, in spite of what some gentlemen have stated to the contrary, I am absolutely in favor of organization, but it depends upon what the organization is for. It depends upon how the organization is controlled. If the organization is privately owned, then I am not for it, because I don’t propose being owned myself; but if the organization is intended for the co-operation of men of like minds, in order to accomplish a common purpose and to advance the fortunes of a party which means <render as="italic" rend="inherit">to serve the nation</render>, then I am for it. You judge an organization by the way in which it is controlled and the objects to which it devotes itself. If it devotes itself to public objects, then every man must believe in it; if it does not, then honest men must withdraw from it—and so I congratulate you upon having the true spirit of organization—an organization which is not meant merely to <word altform="associate">assocciate</word> yourselves together, but to associate yourselves together for a common purpose, a national purpose, a purpose which has for its object legislation to affect the conditions of the whole country. There is something that stirs the red blood in a man when a program of that sort is adopted.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I deem it an honor, therefore, to be associated with such men at the beginning of this campaign, and to have been asked to speak first, is a particular honor, as if I could in some degree voice the purposes you have formed. If I do, it will be simply because I have had a lifelong conviction that a very great degree of wrong has been done this country by the way in which the policy of protection has been applied to its affairs. I am not going into a general discussion of the theory of protection, because, according to a very classical phrase, it is not a theory but a condition which confronts us, a condition of the country, a condition of affairs, an organization of our economic system to our business system which has risen out of a special policy, a special set of circumstances. One of the peculiarities of the tariff question is that it never seems to be settled; it is constantly recurrent, and there must be something very subtle to anybody who has studied history, in coming upon our old familiar friend in this question which has come up in every generation, to vex and perplex the American nation again and again and again. You know it is one of the complaints of our business men that it is never settled; that Congress will not let it alone; will never let business live on any fixed schedule of duties. Now, that is generally said to be true because there is an uneasy set of persons called politicians who must have some means by which to stir up trouble and create unfavorable opinion. The first thing I want to call to your attention—a thing that has caused a great deal of discussion up to the present time—is this: it is not the politicians who have started this business. If you want to take business out of politics, business ought voluntarily to get out of politics. The reason business is in politics now is that it has thrust itself in by going upon every occasion to <place reg="Washington, DC" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Washington</place> and insisting upon getting all that it can get from Congress. Politicians have not put the question of the tariff into politics. Business men have put the question of the tariff into politics and there have been circumstances and situations in our politics of which they were all aware even when they could not be proven. At least one great party was going to control the business interests for fear the things they demanded of their politicians could not be got. Why has the Republican party habitually been associated with the policy of high tariffs? Because the Republican party consisted of a number of gentlemen of a practical turn of mind, who could prove to you the economic necessity of the tariff? Not at all, but because the bills of the Republican party were paid by business men who wanted a high tariff. Now, suppose we put the shoe on the other foot, and invite the gentlemen who want business let alone to let politics alone. I for my part agree to withdraw from troubling business if business will withdraw from troubling politics. I want to know who first steps in and troubles the waters of the pool? We don’t go in first, we are chased out of the pool; we are not allowed to get in first. And so I want to shift the burden of responsibility at the very beginning. Is it the politicians who rush to the hearings of the Ways and Means Committee when this question is going to be touched? Not at all. It is the gentlemen who want the tariff schedules arranged according to their interests who later state “it is just like you politicians, you never let business alone.” I am not jesting; this is the true state of affairs, I suggest a little reciprocity in “letting alone.” I suggest that somebody else take the medicine they try to administer to us. Are they ready to make the bargain? They are not ready to make the bargain yet. They say, “We don’t want the trouble of having to fix this up every time with the Ways and Means Committee. It worries us. We cannot calculate on to-morrow, because we do not know who are going to be members of the Ways and Means Committee. We do not know when it will happen that some men may get on that Committee who know we are hampering them, and when that happens, the game is going to get awkward.”</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Now, having shifted the responsibility, we are going to <render as="italic" rend="inherit">discuss</render> the tariff question. We are to discuss it with the purpose of taking the tariff question out of politics. The only way settle it, is for the good of the country and not for the good of anybody in particular. Link it with special interests; let special interests have the chief interest in it, and you cannot settle it and take it out of politics. But once apply the rule of general interest and you have taken it out of politics. The minute you make it a tariff for revenue you have taken it out of politics. Then you have got something to stand on. I am not saying that you must do this thing offhand, without considering all the vested interests that have been built up. That’s a different proposition. How you are going to do it is a different question. I am now discussing the idea you must hold in view when undertaking it. Well, then, let us realize that there is another reason we are taking up the tariff question again. The tariff question is not now what it was a generation ago. It is not the same question. We are not agitating the old question. We are taking up a question old in one sense, but which must be dealt with under circumstances so radically different that it is now a different question. There was a great deal to be said for the policy of protection. I was going to say a generation ago—but a generation-and-a-half or two generations ago the men in favor of it defended it with the greatest success. They said:</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">“It does not matter how high a tariff wall you build around the country, because here is a great continent with almost inexhaustible resources, in which initiative will build up a great many enterprises of a great many kinds and a great many enterprises of the same kind and prices will be kept down by competition. One of the things the people do not realize is that we have exhibited one of the biggest experiments in business that has ever been set up. There was once free trade within the whole area of this great country, free trade between innumerable competitors, and it was reasonable to expect then, as the earlier advocates of protection did expect, as great men later constantly believed it was reasonable to expect, that prices would be kept down by internal competition. But I don’t have to argue with you. Prices are <render as="italic" rend="inherit">not kept down by internal competition</render>. I don’t have to point out to you gentlemen, noticing that the tariff wall was kept high and there was a snug covering behind it, that the beneficiaries consulted with one another and said: ‘Now, is it really necessary that we should cut one another’s throats?’ These gentlemen in Washington will build this wall as high as we want it built. Let’s get together. If the law is too watchful, let us have an understanding. We are men of honor. We will keep our word of honor. We can form an arrangement by which we can determine, to a very considerable extent at any rate, the price of the raw material. We can, if we will, control the sources of the raw materials, by means <render as="italic" rend="inherit"><foreign lang="Latin">ad libitum</foreign></render>. We can buy mines we do not intend to use for a generation and keep them in our side pockets, and so we can cut out any automatic regulation of this kind, instead of having a price schedule that is not our own and in open competition with the market.”</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Don’t you realize, in short, that the great combinations of modern business have made the old theory of protection absolutely antiquated? It is a preposterous theory. It is very beautiful as theory, but it doesn’t work. If it worked I would have some respect for it, but it is moribund. It has forgot how to work. It is stiff in the joints. And so I say we are not arguing with those who were not revered when alive, but, having died, are very much revered. You know <person reg="[Jonathan Swift?]" link-pointer-type="person">Dean Swift’s</person> cynical translation of the old latin, “When scoundrels die let all bemoan them.” There is a great pity that encaseth the dead, but even the dead, if they were to come back to life, would not say that the theory of protection is what it was once. It has lost all signs of vitality and youth.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Then, there is another circumstance. This country was once in a process of development which has peculiarly come to an end. When <person refurl="x4002536" reg="William C. Redfield" link-pointer-type="person">Mr. Redfield</person> came in this evening, the first thing I said to him was that I would not be here if I hadn’t looked at his speeches. I primed myself on <person refurl="x4002536" reg="William C. Redfield" link-pointer-type="person">Mr. Redfield’s</person> speeches. If he recognizes these points he must forgive me. I really thought of some of them myself. I leave it to him to pick out which is his. But one of the things which has impressed me jibes in with what I have often thought about the sharp turning point that occurred in the year <date value="1898-99-99">1898</date>, after the Spanish War. This marks the end of an epoch for <place reg="The United States of America" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place>. It marks the end of a domestic epoch. After the Spanish War was over we joined the company of nations for the first time—at least for the first time since the very beginning when we were very, very young—a child of the nations, having recently been the colony of a great trading nation. Without wealth we had many other things—a merchant marine, which we have carefully destroyed. Our flag, though a new flag, was on many seas. Our carrying trade was that of a nation young in its nationality, from whose coasts came men who could invade the seas, who could build any kind of craft, who knew the trading laws and trading ports of the round globe. But we invited this generation to forget all this and said: “We are going to shut ourselves in until we have formed this garden of our own.” We have developed that, and an interesting thing has happened, and if I am right in my facts the dealers in grain tell me that we are reaching the point when we won’t export grain, when we will need practically all the grain for our own consumption, and some men may live to see that day unless we do something for our farms. Now, the consequence is we will have no surplus grain to supply the world with at the time we reach the stage where we have a great deal of surplus manufactured product, and the whole thing has turned up by reason of this extraordinary condition.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Do you realize the extent of the audacity of the men who created the protective system? They said, “We are going to see to it that nothing is done for the farmers, who at that time were producing the wealth of the nation, and that everything is done for the men who have not yet produced any wealth at all, and by this process of favoritism and subsidizing of one kind or another, direct or indirect, we have altered the natural plans of life in this country.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">How does it happen that when immigrants come to this country from agricultural regions they do not go to the farms, but are caught in the meshes of our cities? For the same reason that the boys of the plow of our country have been turned away from the farms and into the factories. All the life blood of the country is being drained from the farms into the factories. A great many of the morbid conditions of our society are due to this same excessive fostering of one side of national life at the expense of the other. The alterations and economic balance of our life, the artificial stimulation, have destroyed that poise and which have been created by this protective policy. And now see what a point we have reached. We have stimulated it so much that we have not a large enough market or the means of disposing of the surplus product. This nation calls itself a trading nation, and has the knowledge of other manufacturing nations as to foreign markets, but whenever you have to ship any goods you have to ship them under some other flag than the flag of the <place reg="The United States of America" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place>. How did it happen that we destroyed our own merchant marine and were associated with the policy by which we taxed the stuff out of which ships were built? We could not build them, and so, as if by deliberation, we deprived ourselves of the carrying trade of the world, which, if we had kept on our original plan, we might have had almost to the exclusion of other nations. It is a very rare treat, and possibly more delightful because it is so rare, in foreign waters, to see the stars and stripes on a great ship. I never realized what the stars and stripes meant to me emotionally until one day in <place reg="Plymouth, [MA?]" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Plymouth</place> Harbor I saw a ship sweep past me with the stars and stripes at her gaff. I will remember that flag to my dying day. It was a rare specimen, an isolated testimonial to the spirit of a great national policy. And now we are getting very much interested in foreign markets, but the foreign markets are not particularly interested in us. We have not been very polite, we have not encouraged the intercourse with foreign markets that we might have encouraged, and have obstructed the influence of foreign competition. So these circumstances make the tariff question a new question, our internal arrangements and new combinations of business on one side and on the other our external necessities and the need to give scope to our energy which is now pent up and confined within our own borders, and yet the standpat Republican leaders remain unenlightened, uninformed, absolutely blind and stubborn! They don’t know anything has happened. I wish I remembered some nonsense rhymes I once knew, <render as="underscore" rend="inherit">the only nonsense I ever talked<ref refurl="DE48568719120103001_2" link-pointer-type="Note"/></render>. I would apply them to these gentlemen who talk in the same phrases that were used thirty, forty and fifty years ago; who quote the eminent statesmen of those days, supposing they are talking about the same things then talked about, whereas they cannot find those things anywhere within their range. Now, one of the things they say is that they are the guardians of prosperity and that nothing but the protective system can bring us prosperity, and when you press them to define prosperity they will define it in terms of the bulk of business. One of their most delightful expositions of patriotic purpose is, we must have new industries; if we have not got them we must acquire them at any cost. <person link-pointer-type="person">Professor Taussig</person> calls attention to the fact that in the debate in the Senate on the <person reg="Nelson W. Aldrich" link-pointer-type="person">Aldrich</person> Bill, <person reg="Nelson W. Aldrich" link-pointer-type="person">Mr. Aldrich</person> said, in defense of a duty of 50 per cent. on some article, that he was just as willing to pay 300, 400 or 500 per cent., provided he could thereby bring that industry to this country. <person reg="Nelson W. Aldrich" link-pointer-type="person">Mr. Aldrich’s</person> idea of prosperity is to get as many industries as possible established in this country at any price. Who pays the price, I would like to know? The consumer, of course; but rather the price is distributed in the readjustments of the whole economic system. It is impossible to find who pays it. If you could, you might make him mad. But the trouble is, you cannot convince any body in particular that they are paying it. But we, let us say in general terms, we are paying 50, 100, 200 or 300 per cent. in order that some gentlemen may set up and make a profit in some business that ought not to be set up in <place reg="The United States of America" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place>, because America does not offer the ideal conditions. And that is prosperity! I understand prosperity to be the abundant, intelligent, economic development of resources possessed by the country itself. <render as="italic" rend="inherit">That is prosperity</render>. It is using the plow, engines, mills and water powers of this country just as you would use your own intellectual and physical resources. My prosperity consists in the best possible development of my powers. It does not consist in my loading my back with borrowed plumage that I have to pay something for and wear with an unaccustomed awkwardness. That is not prosperity. And by the same token they say you are making business, therefore you are making employment, and we must assume, we must still assume, that the American workingman is so ignorant, so unintelligent as to suppose they are doing it for his sake. I’d like to know how he ever got into the game? I’d like to know how many gentlemen voluntarily share the profits of production with their workingmen? I know how the workingmen got their share—they got it by saying that they would not work until they did. That’s the way they ever got it. They tell you gentlemen that you cut up the pie very well, but we are not going to supply the pie any more unless we have a piece of it. And I don’t blame them. It’s a grab game, anyhow. That’s exactly what the manufacturers were doing—going down to Washington and saying, “If you don’t give us these things, who is going to pay the campaign expenses this year?” They were on strike, they were combined on strike. Now, it was only treating them with their own medicine when their workingmen said, “We, too, can play at that game. We are on strike. How much are we going to get?” And the only reason they did not get it is they did not have the resources to stay out. That’s the reason the heart of <place reg="The United States of America" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> really sympathizes with the combinations of labor; that’s the only way they are going to prosper in what is a selfish game.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Now, what is really the source of wages? Here I want to say explicitly that I sit at the feet of men like <person refurl="x4002536" reg="William C. Redfield" link-pointer-type="person">Mr. Redfield</person>, who pay wages, who have handled the matter, and who know what they are talking about. Though the political economists say the same things, they don’t say them in the terms of specific instance the way these gentlemen say them. Wages come from the intelligence and energy of the workingmen, made effective by the presence of natural resources and their management by efficient managers. That’s where wages come from. For example, we talk about American laborers competing with the pauper labor of Europe. I heard that only last night, and I thought I was in a dream; it sounded medieval. Haven’t you known a machine that cost <currency type="U.S.A">$500</currency> to compete successfully with a machine that cost <currency type="U.S.A">$50</currency>? That did the same work? Haven’t you known instances where it was profitable, economically profitable, to pay <currency type="U.S.A">$500</currency> rather than <currency type="U.S.A">$50</currency> for a machine, because the machine did so much more and better work, that the <currency type="U.S.A">$500</currency> machine was cheaper than the <currency type="U.S.A">$50</currency> machine? Isn’t that true? Do we protect expensive American machinery against European pauper machinery? What do Englishmen, Frenchmen and Germans—not Germans now, because they have put their unmatched studiousness on to this job—but what do Englishmen in some continental countries do? They send for Americans as experts to tell them how they can make more out of their industrial plants, and what they are told in almost every instance is that they will have to get American machinery, and that means that they have to put their pauper machinery on the junk heap. Isn’t the analogy perfect? I don’t see any fault in it. If they imported American machines and American laborers they would also have to import the superintendents who know how to organize labor. The high cost of production is almost in every instance due, not to high wages, but to the loss and waste in respect of bad management, poor machinery or locating your whole plant in such a way that it is not in proximity to railroads, and the other things necessary to the markets of the country. If you put your factory in, in the right way, organize it right, put right machinery in, and then get the highest priced labor, you will find that you will make your profits; because in proportion as you improve the economic efficiency of your business, your profits will be greater. You need more intelligent laborers and you cannot get them except at a higher price. To my mind that’s rudimentary, but there are gentlemen who have never heard of it. There are manufacturers upon whom that idea has never dawned, and they may not believe it. I give their intelligence the benefit of the doubt. They will tell you that the American manufacturer has to be protected because he has to pay his laborers so much and they will tell the laborer that protection is going to increase his wages, and now the laborer is finding out that they do not increase his wages, and that there is something the matter with the working of the machinery.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">That leads me to the most beautiful theory of all—the theory of the cost of production. It took the Republican party a long time to be absolutely frank in disclosing their ignorance of political economy. They were not perfectly frank until the last campaign, and then they said they wanted to proportion protection—proportion the rate of duty to the difference in the cost of production between American factories and the factories with which they had come into competition abroad. I wonder if those gentlemen wrote that plank with a straight face? I don’t see how it was possible unless they employed someone who didn’t know anything about it. The difference between whom? You say between the foreign manufacturer and the domestic manufacturer. Which foreign manufacturer and which domestic manufacturer? Where is your standard in the difference in cost of production? Suppose you wanted to find differences that, as the tariff commission suggests, are average differences? An average is a variable thing. It might accidentally hit somebody, but I doubt whether it would hit many of us. If reduced it might not hit persons over forty years of age, and if you are going to protect men under forty, what would the poor devils do over forty? They are in more need of protection than the others. The men under forty years of age can take care of themselves, and if you are really going to do the fatherly and generous thing you purpose in the theory of protection, you will take care of the least efficient. They are the ones who need looking after. If you reduce it to an average then you leave out the most helpless of the lot—the men who don’t know how to organize their business, who don’t know how to use their expensive laborers, who don’t know how to use or assemble their expensive machinery or utilize the markets in an intelligent fashion. They are the men toward whom I feel a considerable degree of generosity, and if I was a protectionist I would go the limit and protect the least efficient; and frankly I do not see where you are going to succeed on any other basis. If you protect the least efficient you are going to protect absolutely everybody, and you have reached the ultimate goal of that kind of government—a government that is taking care of everybody and everybody is assured a reasonable profit. Isn’t that a very <render as="italic" rend="inherit"><foreign lang="Latin">reductio ad absurdum?</foreign></render> Otherwise, let us see. We are going to protect the most efficient who know how to do business and who use their resources when needed, to regulate it. You will protect only the trusts, that is to say, if their own account of the matter is to be accepted, because the trusts are defended by great combinations, to bring about the high degree of efficiency caused by protection. I don’t believe it. I believe there is a point in combination beyond which the economy is lost and there is a very great loss and waste. It is like the law of diminishing returns in agriculture. Up to a certain point an addition of fertilizers, an addition of workingmen and additional work on the farm will bring increasing returns, but you reach a limit where you have got too much fertilizer on it and too many men. Then your returns begin to diminish, and there is the same law in industrial combinations. Then let us see: We are going to take those industrial combinations which have reached that highest point of efficiency and protect only them. They are the only fellows who can afford to sell anywhere in the world. Why be benevolent to the self-supporting? It is like reserving your charity and conferring it only on millionaires. These are the gentlemen who know how to run the world, and do run a considerable part of it—and they are going to be protected! Turn any way you please, gentlemen, it is a will o’ the wisp.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Nobody deserves more sympathy than the honest gentlemen who construe the tariff question, because they are put upon this impossible quest to find the cost of production. There is not the same cost of production between any two factories unless they absolutely match each other. Then, there is not the same cost of production in the several parts of the same combination. Now you notice how the combinations meet that matter of the cost of production. Let us see: Where there are twenty mills or factories and a combination is effected they put those various properties into the combination at, let us say, a reasonable figure; that is not generally so, but we will admit it. They then put them in at the real figure of their value. I won’t go on to the next step because that is painful. They then double the whole business with a lot of manipulation, which is a delicate matter, but suppose they went no further than that and put them in at what they are really worth? Then they shut up five or six of them, because, compared with the rest, they are operated at a loss and put out stocks and bonds on the face of those shut up, as well as on the basis of the other fourteen, and we go on paying interest on what it cost to shut those six up. They have eliminated those five or six, but so far as the consumer is concerned they go on as ghostly mills that work while you sleep and you keep paying the price.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Now, the nation could just as well afford to do that as what it is doing now. I would rather have the credit of American efficiency, shut up the inefficient factories and continue to pay out of the public treasury a reasonable profit. I say I’d rather do that than go on letting the inefficient work and go assuring them a reasonable profit. The newly discovered ground is quicksand, and I advise the Republican party to move off before it disappears. They will certainly be engulfed if they stand on that theory long enough. This cost of production has no stability anywhere in it. It is a constant flux and, as <person refurl="x4002536" reg="William C. Redfield" link-pointer-type="person">Mr. Redfield</person> has somewhere said, a disgrace to any concern if it is not a constantly changed quantity. The cost of production ought to be constantly reduced in a business that is making profit. It ought not to stand in the same place for two of twelve months.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Now, what is the conclusion of the whole matter? There are three conclusions. In the first place, we have been doing this thing at a tremendous economic disturbance, artificially changing our whole plans of society, and I fear we will go on doing it at an enormous waste. Has this country really husbanded and used its resources properly? Hasn’t it used them in a way disgracefully wasteful? Haven’t we stopped working a mine the minute it began to be difficult to work? Haven’t we stopped using them the minute our native virgin properties seemed difficult to manipulate? Haven’t we left scrap heaps everywhere? Haven’t we left off taking care of our forests, the splendid trees, ripping and tearing everywhere we have gone? Hasn’t our progress been marked by scenes of devastation? Nothing looked to, nothing saved, nothing utilized to the utmost, though we did not have to utilize it to the utmost. The Government has made everybody pay this bill of wastefulness, and we have even gone to the extent of paying bills of the next generations. Don’t you know the combinations bought up mines they do not intend to use while we are still alive, and we are paying the interest on what it cost them to buy those mines which the next generation is going to use? Isn’t there an enormous economic waste when every generation must not alone pay its own bills, but the next generation’s bills? The whole thing is an extravagant mirage of philanthropy and this economic waste has bred in us something that is contrary to our trade genius; a sort of indulgence of looseness, a method of imperfection.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">In the second place, we have got ourselves in the habit of legislating for the few instead of for the many on an interesting theory that I am very fond of explaining:</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The theory of the Republican party has been, if a few prosper, all will be given a share of their prosperity; if you make great captains of industry rich, they will make the country rich. <render as="italic" rend="inherit">It isn’t so</render>, but we have been foolish enough to believe it sometimes. We have been foolish enough to settle national elections on the belief that it was so. We believed that factories would be shut up and some thousands of poor devils sent out of employment and that symptoms of distress would be established, when there was no genuine necessity for distress at all. Oh, the greed of these men, the indulgence, the eternal indulgence of selfishness! They will say you have paid the bills for us and for our fathers, and you have got to pay them again or we will know the reason why. I don’t feel any bitterness about this, gentlemen; all that is buried; but it is the fact that we should have been so put upon; that we should have been so innocent as to believe the incredible—which we could demonstrate as untrue, if we only took the pains and looked into the facts—what the consumers knew to be untrue at the very time they were patiently casting Republican ballots and made believe they thought it wise; this putting the advantages of legislation in the hands of the few at the constant sacrifice of the many; and the dream of <place reg="The United States of America" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> has been reversed, to a government for the privileged few and not for the many.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">There is a quotation which we have been applauding nearly every <date value="9999-07-04">Fourth of July</date>, as I remember, but which we have not believed since I can remember. We have applied that quotation from the <place reg="Virginia" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Virginia</place> Bill of Rights and from one of <person refurl="x4000491" reg="George Washington" link-pointer-type="person">Washington’s</person> addresses, in which he lays it down as a fundamental conception of American affairs, that when the people deem their government is not serving their interests they have a right to resume it into their own hands. Haven’t you heard that before and haven’t you applied it? Well, do you believe it? <place reg="The United States of America" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> has not acted upon that in my lifetime. That belief is merely intended to be engraved in golden letters upon some tablet of our memories and enshrined as a fragrant recollection.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Now, there is another thing that this has done—and I am ashamed to see how long I have spoken—it has reversed all our natural conceptions of government. The worst feature of protection is the demoralization of our political ideas. We have based government upon patronage and privilege instead of upon justice and equality. That’s the cancer that eats at the hearts of all.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Now, what are we going to do? Are we going to turn revolutionists? Are we going to act as free traders? I wish I might hope that our grandchildren could indulge in free trade, but I am afraid even they cannot because they have to pay the bills of the Federal Government. We have a Federal system of government, and it is wise, it is good housekeeping, it is good management to leave direct taxes, for the most part, to the State government, because they have current bills to pay. It is likely that for an indefinite period we shall have to pay our national bills by duties collected at the ports. Though I am not for drastic changes, yet I wish I saw some ultimate escape from it. At present I do not. Therefore, what we have to ask ourselves is not the principle upon which we are to act, for that is plain. We are to act upon the fundamental principle of the Democratic party, not free trade, <render as="italic" rend="inherit">but tariff for revenue</render>, and we have got to approach that by such avenues, by such stages, and at such a pace as will be consistent with the stability and safety of the business of the country. Fortunately, there are some things that are plain. The very wide-awake gentlemen who constitute the Democratic majority in the lower house of Congress saw the opening in the line and carried the ball through. They saw the schedules upon which it was safe to act, and unanimously agreed that it was safe and wise to act now, which they did; and now they may have to act again to the same effect, because all excuses, so far as I can see, for any co-operation, are swept away. Many excuses were offered. The cover of the Tariff Bill was an excellent cover while it lasted, but the Tariff Board has uncovered the defense and now there are certain schedules upon which our minds are fixed, with a sufficient illumination of the facts and conditions to enable us to act upon them. We can act upon them, and feeling our way prudently here and there, not like doctrinaires but like practical and prudent men, we can by prudent stages bring this tariff down to our children on a proper tariff basis. That’s a plain program. It is a practical man’s program. It is not a theoretical program; it is not a program based upon a desire to get even with anyone; it is not a program based upon patience that special privilege has exhausted; it is merely an open-minded, prudent, statesmanlike course of action.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I congratulate you, gentlemen, upon undertaking this campaign of education, not of agitation; of demonstration, not of abuse; a campaign where the facts will be more eloquent than figures of speech, and where back of the whole thing will lie that natural impulse of public service, upon which alone a permanent national policy can be founded.</p>

Wilson</person>.</render></p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I recognize the part I am to play on this occasion and will at once relieve you of any apprehension that I am going to occupy any considerable portion of your time.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">This club is nonpartisan, which means, I take it, not that a party man is barred out, but only that neither is his opponent or critic barred out. <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">New Jersey</place> has lent us her <personRef refurl="x4000418" reg="Woodrow Wilson" link-pointer-type="person">governor</personRef> who in less than two years’ time has become a national figure of the first magnitude and whose name is now a household word from one end of the country to the other. If I may indicate very generally and briefly the characteristics of so short and yet so distinguished a career, I begin by asking you to note one which every citizen wants to see in every public man, be he of his own party or any other, and that is the capacity for leadership. The speech or the writing or the act even is as nothing to the man behind it and to the impression he makes of sincerity, trustworthiness, and general sanity of mind and thought. Be the merits of the great fight in the New Jersey Legislature of <date value="1911-99-99">1911</date> what they may, it brought out a sturdy and sagacious leadership, which won the admiration and respect of foes and the permanent confidence of friends.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">There may be, of course, a wrong leadership as well as a right, and when the leadership of a great political party in a free country is concerned, what will be the evidence that the leadership will be wise, that it will rise to the height of great social and political problems; that on the one hand it will not be led away by the abstractions of the doctrinaire, nor on the other hand fail to recognize and apply the essential principles of all popular government? On that point no other or greater assurance is possible than that the leadership shall be  a thoroughly educated and informed leadership, a result possible only if the leader shall have made the principles of political science the subject of the closest thought and study and shall have familiarized himself with the history of their application in his own country.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Finally, we live in times when not the foundation but the superstructure of our political house seems to be shaken by the winds of strange doctrines. The foundation is democratic and is solid and means government by the people for the people. But there is intense and widespread dissatisfaction because the claim and belief that our vaunted government by the people for the people is, in fact, government by a class for a class. The present and burning question for statesmanship is, What is the remedy? Is it less democracy or more democracy? Just what shape the prescription shall take—just what measures shall restore to the people their proper power over their own government—is a question over which men may honestly differ, will certainly exhaust the resources of the highest statesmanship, and, perhaps, will never be truly and finally answered until after a period of long and painful experiment.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I am about to present to you a man whose life work thus far is a conspicuous exhibit of the traits and convictions and accomplisments to which I have briefly referred. I am presenting him, not as a high official, nor as a candidate, nor as a Democrat, but as an American citizen entitled to the respect and esteem of men of whatever political faith; as a man who has made good wherever he has been tried; who has proved his possession of the inestimable gift of leadership; who has vindicated the claims to regard of the “scholar in politics”; who, sensible of the abuses which have come to disfigure the administration of popular government, has lost not a jot of faith in popular government itself; and who is of the type of men in whom lies the best hope for the country’s future. I may add that he has a capacity and propensity for telling the truth, which is not always to the advantage or satisfaction of those who ask for it.</p>

         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Mr. President, your excellency, your honor, gentlemen of the real estate exchange, I am not going to talk about politics. I am simply going to discuss public questions. And there is a difference, a very great difference, between discussing politics and talking about public questions. Indeed, it is very difficult to talk politics in <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> now, because you can not be certain where any man you are talking to belongs.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">There is what a football man would call a very broken field, and it is almost impossible to classify men any longer in <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place>, at any rate, after you get them out of the field of their own businesses.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">You can not classify a man about other things until you have talked to him for a long time; and it is incredible that a thoughtful man in this State should really be a standpatter, because the penalty of being such is that the whole of your generation and your civilization will run away from you if you don’t move with it.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The theme of my thought <word altform="tonight">to-night</word> as I came here is that we are not at the beginning of a new age, not at its immediate beginning, but near its beginning, and that everything, whether we wish it to do so or not, wears a new aspect for us. Almost every question which it is imperatively necessary we should consider and discuss is, if not a new question, now developed in such a new aspect for <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> that we must treat it as if it were a new question.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">For example, it seems to me that the most pressing thing in <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> is the question of conservation, not merely the conservation of so much as remains of our unwasted resources—I do not mean the mere renewal of our forests; I do not mean mere preservation and a more economical use of our water power—I mean the preservation of our energies and of the genius of our people.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Questions of sanitation to me are questions of conservation; questions of morals are questions of conservation. You can not conserve the energy of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> unless you give to its exercise the proper moral environment. You can not get the best work <sic corr="out">our</sic> of your workmen unless you make them by honest operations to believe that you regard them, not as your tools, but as your partners; and the whole conservation of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> is a question of the supremacy of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place>, of her right thinking, and of her righteous action. We owe it to future generations that we should not waste or destroy our resources, and we owe it still more to future generations that we should not lower the vitality of our workingwomen, check the vitality of our children, demoralize the proceses of our life at any point. And yet how long is it since <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> troubled herself with questions of conservation? How long is it since we felt in the hey day of thoughtless youth, with so much youth at our hands, that we did not have to be careful in the economy of it; and how constantly did we rejoice that we had put ourselves in a position to be wasteful.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Almost every time public questions are discussed in this day somebody asks the question: “What is the leading question of the approaching political campaign?” Now, I don’t know what is the leading question, but I know what is the central question, or at least I think I do, because I find that every road leads to that question, and that it is the question of the tariff. The question of conservation leads straight to that same radical origin, to this road of the tariff, becasue by protecting ourselves from foreign competition—from the skill and energy and resourcefulness of other nations—we have felt ourselves at liberty to be wasteful in our own processes. I believe that it is one of the most serious consequences of the protective tariff that it has made it unnecessary that we should be careful and saving in our own industrial enterprises. I am going to return to that presently, but for the time being let me point out simply this: That we can afford behind the wall of our tariff to pay for business that we are not doing.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">What I mean is this: Take almost any modern combination. Suppose that 20 factories are drawn together in a single organization. Those 20 factories are not all of them similarly equipped for efficiency and economy of action, and it constantly happens that after the necessary money is put into the capitalization for the union of those factories under a single organization a number of them are put out of operation rather than brought up to the hightest point of efficiency  and thereafter are carried as dead enterprises. Now, you could not afford to do that if you had to make every part most efficient in action. You could not afford to carry cold furnaces; you could not afford to carry silent looms; you could not afford to put up shutters and make people to whom you sell your goods pay for what you paid to put up the shutters.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">We can afford to carry dead business in this country because we have not exposed ourselves to universal competition with live business. And so, finding it possible to do things of that sort, we have gone further—we are paying for things we have not yet used.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">There are combinations in this country, for example, in which men have bought mines which they have never opened and which they are carrying, and probably will carry, until the next generation, while we pay the piper. They don’t want anybody else to use the mines, and we are paying for what the next generation will use.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Have you realized the loads, the dead weights, that American business is carrying? You may not have analyzed it in this way, but whether you have analyzed it in this way or not, the prices we are paying for manufactured goods in this country tell the tale of what we have been trying to do. And when we swing our thought back to the question of conservation we see nothing less than this: That now we have got to the point where we have got to do something very different, because the question of trade is a new question in this country.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I have no doubt that the explanations which <person link-pointer-type="person">Gen. Bancroft</person> offers for the falling off in the export business of <place reg="Boston, MA" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Boston</place> is one of the explanations for that decrease nationally. I have no doubt that the differential rate in favor of <place reg="Baltimore, MD" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Baltimore</place> has a great deal to do with it, but there is something else that has to do with it.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Have you looked at the general course of the export trade in this country? Don’t you know that the export of grain is steadily going down from natural causes? We used to produce so much more grain than we needed ourselves that we could afford to export enough to feed the greater part of the rest of the world.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">But with the increase in our population at a greater rate than the productivity of our soil—or, rather, the use of our soil after the productive fashion—the exports of grain are falling because we need more of it ourselves, and during the same period when this has become marked our exports of manufactured articles have been increasing almost in spite of us by leaps and bounds.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">While we have been producing less and less grain in proportion to our power of consumption, we have been producing more and more manufactured goods in proportion to our power of consumption, until now we have a surplus of manufactured goods of which we must get rid or else do an unprofitable business.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">At this point we discover that we have done something very singular, considering we are Americans. In the first place, by processes which you know just as well as I do, we destroyed our commercial marine.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I am not going to try to distrubute the blame or to consider whether the measures which produced this effect were well considered at the outset or not. We can afford to be indifferent as to whether they were or not, because we are considering the present or future.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The point is now that you are more likely to see the flag of the little Kingdom of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Greece</place> on the seas than the flag of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place>. History shows, and this particular part of the country will bear witness to the statement, that whereas we were once noted as the common carriers of the Atlantic, whereas we once furnished the seamen and ships for a very considerable proportion of the commerce of the ocean, we have, for one reason or another, lost that carrying trade, and you also know, if you are merchants, that the nation which carries the world’s goods can generally see to it that its merchants get the markets.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">When we need markets, therefore, now that we are needing them, we have not the hands by which to reach out and take them. Our merchant seamen are gone. Our ships have disappeared from the sea, our registry lists are short and insignificant, and by the same token, while we had surrounded ourselves with this wall of the tariff and were rejoicing in the great area of free trade which we could enjoy in <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> under our own vine and fig tree, we were becoming ignorant of the markets of the world.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Where are the great East Indian merchants who used to have offices in <place reg="Boston, MA" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Boston</place>? Where are those men who understood the tastes and the needs of the ends of the earth? Where are the men who knew exactly what to send to <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">India</place> in order to exchange for what <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">India</place> could send to us to satisfy our tastes and needs?</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The great trading nations of the world are not those who understand only domestic needs and tastes. They are those who understand the foreign needs and tastes. I heard it quoted from a great cotton manufacturer <word altform="today">to-day</word> that if we only had 200,000,000 instead of 100,000,000 people in this country we would have enough people to take up the full capacity of the cotton factories of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place>.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Well, lacking the additional hundred million, what are we going to do with our surplus goods? We have got to do something we do not know how to do now to make cotton goods of the kind and pattern that are salable in all quarters of the world, and then to place them there.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">But the tariff has made this extremely difficult, and at the same time we are preparing transformations for ourselves. What is the completion of that <abbr expan="Panama Canal">great ditch</abbr> now being dug through the Isthmus going to mean to some of the Atlantic seaports? When you take the differential off which will even things between you and <place reg="Baltimore, MD" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Baltimore</place>, how are you going to see your way out—how are you going to prevent the great blood of the economic life of the Nation from running down the Mississippi Valley? Where are you going to be when the arteries run north and south instead of east and west?</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">And after you have got your dock frontage, how are you going to bring the ships of the world here if the currents of trade are shifting, shifting, shifting in spite of you?</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Stand pat when the world is changing? Sit still when everything is altering, whether you want it to alter or not? Tell your politicians to let you alone to the enjoyment of your false security when you are not secured at all? When the world itself is being transformed, will you refuse yoruselves to alter your thinking?</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">There is no such lack of intelligence in this great city of <place reg="Boston, MA" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Boston</place> as to dream of the possibility of an inconceivable thing like that. You have got, in order to relieve the plethora, in order to use the energy of the capital of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place>, to break the chrysalis that we have been in. We have bound ourselves hand and foot in a smug domestic helplessness by this jacket of a tariff we have wound around us. [Applause.] We are not about to change the tariff because men in this country have changed their theories about the tariff. We are going to change it because the conditions of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> are going to burst through it and are now bursting through it.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">You can not fight a Spanish war and join the family of nations in international affairs and still keep your gaze directed inward upon yourself, because along with the singular change that came upon us, that notably altered or affected the very character of our Government, the Nation itself began to be a different thing. Have you ever thought of the history of our Government, of the history of the Executive part of it? Do you not know that down to the period when we began to shut our doors tight against foreign commercial intercourse the Executive was the most important part of the Government of the United States, and then we went through a long period when, except for the Civil War when there was concentrated energy to be found, the Executive counted for almost nothing and the Congress for almost everything, because every question was a neighborhood question? It was our own. We had not any national spokesman such as the Executive is prepared to serve us. And then came the Spanish War, and since then do you think it is a question that the Executive has again become a conspicuous part of this Government? So soon as a nation must act you must have a body through which it can act. So soon as it becomes a single will you have to have  a lodgment for the guiding intelligence, a single will in every nation that is important in international relations—a strong guiding Executive—not because it deliberately chooses to have it, but because it has no choice—it must have it. And so while we have waited and drifted in altruistic fashion into a war for the sake of the Cubans, we altered the center of gravity of our Government. Will we never learn this fact: That you do not make governments by theories? You accomodate theories to the circumstances. Theories are generalizations from the facts. The facts do not spring out of the theories. If they did we would have a very symmetrically ordered series of facts, but the facts break in and ignore the theories—contemptuously smash the theories—and as our life is, as our thought is, so will our Government be.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Very well; our thoughts are concentrated upon ourselves. Now, we are changing our point of view and looking abroad upon the face of the earth, seeking to allow ourselves an outline into the general field of competition, which includes the whole round globe. In the meantime what have we done? Do you really think that the tariff has produced efficiency? Do you believe that combinations, most of which have been made possible by the tariff, have had as their chief effect efficiency and economy? Every tyro knows that, up to a certain point, combination produces economy. But it does not necessarily produce efficiency. That depends upon who runs the combination and on the amount of brains invested, not on the amount of capital pooled; and after you have got your combination, what do you do with it? I do not mean what you say you do with it in public discussions. What do you actually do with it? You have only to ask to look into the testimony before the Stanley Committee; you have only to look into the testimony in the trial of the meat packers; you have only to look in the public records to find what is done with some combinations. There are private understandings with regard to prices. Everybody knows that, and that the penalty of not observing those prices and keeping to them is to be put out of the combination, and it looks—I will not make this as assertion, but I will venture to say—as if the object of some combinations was the prices, not the efficiency, not economy, but the avoiding of the very things that make economy and efficiency absolutely imperative. I do not have to be efficient over and above the point that the men I am in competition with makes it necessary that I should be efficient. If I know enough to know more than the fellow that I am competing with I do not have to increase my knowledge. If I understand the game well enough to check-mate him I do not have to understand it any better, and if I can enter into an understanding with him I do not have to understand it at all. [Laughter.] So that my conviction is—and I think that the admission of every candid mind will be—that in recent decades we have been decreasing our efficiency.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">There is only one thing upon which efficiency depends, and that is the whole thing. You can not get efficiency out of your workmen if you overdrive them, any more than you can get it out of your machines if you overdrive them. Did you ever notice how much more tender and considerate of their machines some American manufacturers are then they are of the human beings they employ? Do not you know that every thoughtful manufacturer studies what his machinery will bear, and he will dismiss an employee who puts more on that machine than it can bear or than he ought to put on it? Very well; does he dismiss the same superintendent who puts more on the human muscle and spirit than it can bear? Not often. When you find a manufacturer who is considerate of the strain on his men and who makes them feel that he is taking as much care of them as of his machinery you find the most efficient establishment in the trade. [Applause.]</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Would it not be  a good idea to draw your cost sheets after a new fashion? Would it not be a good idea to have a cost sheet to show the strain put upon the men in every respect—not merely the physical strain, but a sheet which would show the strain put on them by lack of ventilation in the factory, by the lack of opportunities of amusement, by the absence of the feeling on the part of the workmen that they are really regarded as essential partners in a mutual undertaking which makes every man just as eager to make the product good as his employer could possibly be? It would be a moral balance sheet of the whole industry of the Nation. Do not you see how I am traveling in a circle? It is a question of conservation. Conservation is a question of efficiency. Efficiency depends upon those finer economies which assemble all the elements of energy, and economy is simply another way of spelling the word honesty, thriftiness, getting out of every ton of coal every unit of energy that there is in it without waste, throwing nothing away, making profit out of everything, but particularly out of your relations with your fellow men.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">We have this question to answer, therefore, gentlemen, and this is the central question of all politics and it is a perfectly nonpartisan question: What do you want, the economical adjustment, the moral adjustment, the physical adjustment which will produce these results, or do you want a fetish, called protection, behind which there will be waste, plus security? Do you really want to admit that you can not make the American Nation more efficient than any other nation in the world?</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The only reason that <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> is efficient is that American brains are capable of entering into any competition that you can conceive of. The central thing is that so long as we keep American life relatively what we intended it to be, we have only to import a workman who earns 30 cents a day on the other side of the water and find him in an employ earning $2 a day on this side of the water. A man can not change the dexterity of his fingers or his physical make-up in a month, but he can change his point of view. He can catch the infection of the factory in which he works. He can recognize under the intelligent supervision of the superintendent that through his participation and because he has become a constituent part of the great throbbing American machine that we call civilization he can be an infinitely better workman than he is anywhere else.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">When you want to cut down your working force, which of your workmen do you dismiss first? Those that get the smallest wages. You don’t dismiss the high-priced men first. If you did you would dismiss the president and secretaries first and superintendents, and you can not get on without those who earn the larger salaries. You don’t dismiss from the top, but from the bottom, which is your admission that the most economical labor you have it your highest-priced labor. That is what you can not dispense with. It is high priced not because of the tariff. Oh, I wish I had time to explode that ancient myth. No thoughtful economist in the world knows so little as not to be able to explode it. Only business men who will not take the pains to become economists believe it, and some of them do not believe it.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">A friend of mine who travels all over the world and sells a certain kind of American machine tells me he can sell <currency type="U.S.A">$350</currency> machines in competition with an <currency type="U.S.A">$80</currency> machine that does the same work because the <currency type="U.S.A">$350</currency> machine is more economical, it produces more in a given time and better goods in a given time, yields more to the intelligence of those who use it in a given time than the <currency type="U.S.A">$80</currency> machine, and the <currency type="U.S.A">$350</currency> machine is cheaper, produces a smaller labor cost than the <currency type="U.S.A">$80</currency> machine.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">And the man who earns <currency type="U.S.A">$10</currency> a day, if he really earns it, is cheaper to you than the <currency type="U.S.A">$1</currency>  a day man. And you can afford nothing so ill as to turn away from the idea, from the conception, that American labor is supreme because it is intelligent and not because it gets higher wages. That is a false reasoning; you are putting the cart before the horse. American labor gets higher wages because it is more valuable. Now, any intelligent labor can compete with any pauper labor, and the intellectual absurdity of “protecting” intelligent men from unintelligent is too patent to need explanation. When I hear the reports that tell of protecting American laborers that I know of against the pauper labor of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Europe</place> I can only smile that my fellow voters are so gullible.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Now, gentlemen, you can not afford to be narrow in the presence of change, and you can not afford to think that your legislators and your executives are bringing change upon you. Neither can you afford to think that you can take no guiding part in the change. We are facing a new age, with new objects, new objects of American trade and manufacture, because the minute you begin to make models for foreign sale you have to change the machinery, the whole point of view. We are facing new objects with new standards, the standards of cosmopolitan intelligence instead of provincial intelligence, and with a new conception of what it means to produce wealth and produce prosperity. The prosperity of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> has often been checked, but it has seldom been aided by legislation. I wonder how any man can keep the red corpuscles in his blood from getting up and shouting when he realizes the age that we are entering upon.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I was saying <word altform="today">to-day</word> to some of the fellows out at <place reg="Harvard University" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Harvard</place> that I wished I had been born 20 years later, so that I could have had 20 years more of this exhilarating century upon which we have entered, a century which greets the challenge to originative effort. This is no century for any man who looks over his shoulder; it is no century for any man who has no stomach for the facts that change even while he tries to digest them; a century in which <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> is to prove once more whether she has any right to claim leadership in the world of originative politics and originative economic effort. This is a century just as worth living in as was the eighteenth century, better worth living in than was the nineteenth century.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">When I hear men say that you are attacking American civilization by proposing, not rapid, but slow, steady—if necessary, organic—changes to meet the facts, I wonder what they think of when they look at the flag of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place>. The flag of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> stands for the biggest kick on record.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The flag of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place>, in my imagination, consists of alternate strips of white parchment upon which are written the aspirations of men, and streams of blood poured out to verify their hope, and in the corner of that flag sparkle the stars of those States that have one after another swung into the firmament to show that there is  a God in heaven, that men will not abandon hope so long as they have confidence in the God of righteousness, the God of justice, the God of liberty. [Loud applause.]</p>

Woodrow Wilson</person>, <date value="1912-06-04">June 4, 1912</date>.</render></p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Mr. President and members of the <name type="org">American Medical Association</name>, ladies and gentlemen, I feel it a privilege, as representing the State of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">New Jersey</place>, to welcome this great society to its session this year in <place reg="Atlantic City, NJ" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Atlantic City</place>.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">A great many people come to <place reg="Atlantic City, NJ" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Atlantic City</place> on all sorts of errands, most of them not serious. [Laughter.] The problems that <place reg="Atlantic City, NJ" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Atlantic City</place> is confronted by is that it is the refuge of the idle, and those who are idle are apt to adjourn the ordinary standards of their lives. [Laughter.] But you are doubly welcome here, because you have not come as idlers but as those who study the more serious problems of our lives, both individually and nationally.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve"><place reg="Atlantic City, NJ" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Atlantic City</place> is used now to investigation. [Laughter.] You have come as investigators, not to investigate <place reg="Atlantic City, NJ" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Atlantic City</place>, except for your intimate knowledge of the make-up, the physical make-up of all citizens of the community [laughter], and I feel in facing a great association like this that I am facing a body of men and women who have a particularly intimate connection with the life of the country, because you are very much more than physicians individually. You are very much more than the advisers of individuals with regard to the problems of health. You are the guardians of communities. You are the guardians of communities not only with regard to those general sanitary problems which are summed up under the head of sanitation and general hygiene, for example, but of a great many moral problems also. In our day the old story that the physical welfare of man is very closely knit with the moral is very true, and as a man thinks so is he, a thing which comes very much nearer being a physical fact than is usually realized, because there is undoubtedly an air of morale in most of the problems that you have to deal with. At any rate, by way of preliminary determination and as counselors or individuals, you are the arbiters, to some degree, of the life of communities.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I have sometimes wished there might be some way of establishing an official connection between doctors and the State that has been found in the case of lawyers. Lawyers are officers of the court, and are subject to discipline as such. They hold in their hands the honor of obeying and carrying out the laws of the Commonwealth, and they are held amenable on that basis. It is on that basis that men are dealt with for contempt of court and lawyers are held to a code which has nothing to do with their knowledge of the law. Similarly, it seems to me, the doctor, by reason of the license he holds, is reputed to represent morality as well as the knowledge of the community. [Applause.] And the most interesting part of the profession is this, that knowledge is not vital unless it goes hand in hand with honesty and sympathy. I believe you will agree with me that one of the things to be regretted in modern times is that we have been obliged to specialize our professions to so great a degree, because in proportion as the medical profession is specialized, for example, the old family physician disappears.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I remember going over in my memory a single year of my family life with my children when they were small and finding that I had called in consultation 13 different specialists. [Laughter.] There was no ill luck in the 13, because it all came out very happily. But where I had summoned 13 specialists <personRef refurl="x4002340" reg="Joseph R. Wilson" link-pointer-type="person">my father</personRef> would have summoned 1 family physician. <personRef refurl="x4002340" reg="Joseph R. Wilson" link-pointer-type="person">My father</personRef> would not have got as good advice as I got, and yet I lived through it. [Laughter and applause.] But every time he sent for his doctor he was sending for a personal friend. He was sending for a man who had his confidence in a peculiar degree. He was sending for a man who walked along the paths of life with him as a comrade and confidant. There was something very vital, there was something very useful in that relationship, and although we have certainly yielded only to necessity, it is unfortunate that we should have been obliged to specialize so much as we have, and therefore it is necessary, it seems to me, if you will permit me to suggest it, that we regeneralize our sympathies. I remember saying once, when I was following out a certain occupation, that I understood the chief business of the university was to make young men as unlike their fathers as possible.  I will hasten to explain that as I did no that occasion. I did not then, nor do I say that now, in disrespect to the fathers, but merely this: By the time a man was old enough to have a son in the university he became so immersed in a special occupation and narrowed to the point of a single calling, it was advisable that his son should be taken out on some place of vantage where he could see the world, instead of seeing a single individual, a single community, a single profession. I understood that to be the business of the university to regeneralize each generation of youngsters, show them the Nation, show them the great infinite variety of human interests, show them the map of the world, so that they would never forget, at any rate, their general geographic relations to the races of mankind. So, it seems to me, every profession, particularly a profession so absorbed as yours is, and bent upon investigations, must find it necessary to refresh its general sympathies by reconnecting itself with the wider questions of our modern life.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">As an American I feel that the task of a statesman in our day is analogous to the task of the surgeon. There is a great deal that is necessary to be cut out of modern life [laughter], and yet we must be very careful not to injure any of the sound tissue in cutting it out, and the various processes of politics are not unlike the processes with which you are familiar. The preliminary agitations of a political campaign are a sort of prognosis [laughter] and the platforms are a sort of diagnosis, and then follows the critical part. [Laughter.] Then you have to study your materia medica; then you have to propose a particular operation and determine exactly what you are going to do in following up your diagnosis to remove the disease, or, at any rate, to apply some tonic which will enable nature to assist herself. [Laughter.]</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The moral of that sort of thing is that the surgeon should know what he is about, and that rough and ready methods, methods of passion, methods of prejudice, are of all things the most dangerous. [Applause.] They are the methods of the quack; they are the methods of the uneducated, the uninstructed, the unlicensed practitioner, and therefore I have a sort of sympathy with you. [Laughter.] It is very much easier for you to get at the difficulty and the particular phenomenon with which you have to deal than it is for the men who are wandering abroad amidst the general phenomena of society; and yet, it seems to me, that you can be infinitely instrumental in assisting the statesman, because there are a great many evidences and symptoms at this time of hysteria [laughter], and if you will only hurry home from this convention and calm your communities down we may be able to transact business. [Roars of laughter.]</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I am very glad to have you all at once in <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">New Jersey</place>, but you can not calm <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">New Jersey</place> by merely sitting here in <place reg="Atlantic City, NJ" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Atlantic City</place>. It will be necessary for you to disperse to your homes and get to work on the people you know. I know a great many people whom I would like to get to work on [laughter] if I only knew the proper cure for hysteria, but never having, happily, felt the symptoms myself, I am unsympathetic about it. And yet, seriously, ladies and gentlemen, speaking of the problems of our life, they are all one. The thing I am particularly impatient with, ladies and gentlemen, is dividing our lives and our intersts into sections and supposing you know nothing about anything, except one thing. The whole problem of modern society is infinitely complicated, just because it is variously specialized, and it should be our object to avoid the separation of interests, but a body of unified interests, moving forward to the common goal of general service. That, it seems to me, is the problem of all intelligent men in the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> and in the world at large. I can not do better, therefore, than to ask you in your modern occupation to harmonize the various parts of our whole life to one another, so that heat, hostility, and friction may be taken out and all the sweet and wholesome processes of life may be restored. [Loud and prolonged applause.]</p>

         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I take it for granted that the significance of a
            Sunday school lies in this circumstance: that it is an attempt to
            carry along the religious education of the nation with the secular
            education of it. Almost all my life I have been engaged in
            educational work. I have always had the same conception of it, from
            the beginning until now, namely, that education is a fundamental
            part of progess, that you can’t make progress unless you tie one
            generation in with another. Any disconnection between one generation
            and another will be a break, and may be a fatal break in the
            continuity of progress. You can’t make progress in disconnected
            groups and, therefore, with each generation you have to take the
            younger people as they come on and supply them with those conditions
            of thought which have sustained the progress of the generations that
            have come before them. You have to see to it that the light that has
            been accumulated by scholars and sages and men of profound
            experience shall not be dissipated, because the next generation
            knows nothing of it.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">There is a sense in which education may be said to be
            the memory of the race—recollecting its experiences, building upon
            the things that it has done, not forgetting its successes and always
            remembering its mistakes; throwing aside the things that have not
            borne the test of time and of thought and discovery, and going on to
            those things which are more and more sanctioned from generation to
            generation by what is known and thought and discovered in the world.
            You know that one of the experiences of the Christian Church has
            been that it from time to time has feared the effect of discovery
            and the effect of scientific thought—the effect of the thought based
            upon the mere phenomena of nature—upon the teachings derived from
            the Bible. It has turned out to be an idle fear, because there has
            never been any fundamental discrepancies between the teachings of
            the Bible, which is God’s written word, and the teachings of nature,
            which is God’s cipher—which we make out more and more distinctly
            from generation to generation. Religious education is education in
            this very Word of God; not the Word of God written in nature, for
            that is the study of the schools on week days, but the Word of God
            written in his Scriptures.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">For my part, I am interested in Sunday school work
            only as a study of the Scriptures. The only significant book,
               <render as="italic" rend="inherit">the only book that can have any possible
               significance as a text book in the Sunday school is the <name type="title">Bible</name> itself</render>, and as we must
            train our children in the rest of the thought of the world, we must
            if we are to make progress as a nation ground each generation as it
            comes along in the established and tested moral judgments of the
            world. When you think what this is—what all men in all ages have
            been in search of—the search for what is right to do and right to
            think and right to feel is not a search confined to Christian
            nations. It began long before the Bible began to have the pervasive
            and general influence that it has in the modern world. The great
            thinkers of the old so-called heathen nations thought along these
            profound lines of human morality—of the things that made human life
            pure, effective and happy. I take it that what every man and woman
            in the world is in search of in the last analysis, is happiness, and
            that the trouble with the greater part of the world is the
            superficial view it takes of happiness. So many people waste so many
            years of their life in the pursuit of those things which they fancy
            will bring them satisfaction, but which bring them only repining and
            disgust. The search of the world is for peace of mind, happiness of
            relationship, the joy of living and of sharing the life of others.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">If you turn to the works of <person link-pointer-type="person">Dante</person>,
            the great Italian writer, to that extraordinary book of his which he
            denominated “<name type="title">The Divine Comedy</name>,” you will
            find the same thing. There is one thing in <person link-pointer-type="person">Dante</person>
            which is, perhaps, to be found nowhere else. One of
            <person link-pointer-type="person">Dante’s</person> books—one of the divisions of his great
            work—is entitled “The Inferno,” in other words, it is entitled
            “Hell.” It is a picture of the life of the damned, and the
            significant thing of that book is that <person link-pointer-type="person">Dante</person> picks
            out characters living at the time that his book was written, and
            shows them already in hell, displaying, perhaps, for the first time
            in literature the significant fact that a man goes to hell of his
            own volition and of his own character, and gets there before he
            dies; that hell is the moral setting which he has made for his own
            life. It is the debauching and debasing of his own motives, it is
            the conscience that he lives and sleeps with, and he is tortured
            long before the day comes when he shall render his final account.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Is there no man present who can testify to that? Is
            there no man present who tosses uneasily on his bed at night because
            of the things that he remembers that he did in the day time? Is
            there no man here who works feverishly during the day in order that
            he may forget what he did yesterday? Is there no man here who
            resorts to strong drink in order to forget? Is there nobody here who
            knows the impulse of plunging into that stream of forgetfulness that
            the ancients called the Stream of Lethe? You know what
            <person link-pointer-type="person">Dante</person> meant when he depicted those still living as
            already caught in the tortures of iniquity; and so all great serious
            literature has this first or last as its theme: What was man born
            into the world for? What are the motives which will lift him along
            the highway? What are those that will drive him downward into the
            pit?</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The beauty about the <name type="title">Bible</name>
            is that it is the most wholesome, the most perfectly symmetrical,
            the least morbid picture of life and motives of men in the world.
            Almost every other book has a streak of morbidness in it, but this
            book is wholesome and sweet and natural and naif from cover to
            cover. Here are no dull moralizings; here is the life of man set
            forth as it was simply lived from generation to generation. I take
            it that the problem which you would all study for the Sunday school
            is the biographies and the histories of the Old Testament and of the
            New. I suppose that the Epistles of the New Testament are for the
            perusal of those who are mature, because in the Epistles is set
            forth, as it were, the philosophy of the whole thing, the thoughtful
            reflection based upon the providence of God and the revelation of
               <personRef reg="Jesus Christ" link-pointer-type="person">His Son</personRef>. The Epistles
            constitute the theology of the <name type="title">Bible</name>, and
            the rest of it constitutes the experience of mankind in contact with
            Divine Providence.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The reassuring thing about the <name type="title">Bible</name> is that its biographies are not like any other
            biographies that you know of. Take up almost any biography outside
            of the <name type="title">Bible</name> and the writer tries to make
            a hero of the man he is writing about. No writer in the <name type="title">Bible</name> tries to make a hero out of mere human
            stuff. There isn’t a character of the <name type="title">Bible</name>—there isn’t a character even amongst those who are
            picked out by the <name type="title">Bible</name> itself, by the
            special representatives and ambassadors of God, whose life is not
            displayed as full of faults and shortcomings and natural slips from
            the way of virtue. It were a matter of despair to those of us who
            have come after, if the <name type="title">Bible</name> had
            represented these persons as unimpeachable in character and
            unexceptional in their conduct, because the theme of the <name type="title">Bible</name>, so far as it is a biography, is the
            theme of the discovery of itself by the human soul, is the theme of
            the slow “come on” which each man and woman may gain for himself or
            herself under the guidance of the Spirit of God.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">After all, we fight not with flesh and blood, but with
            unseen forces, most of which are within ourselves. The <name type="title">Bible</name> says: “Let no man say he was tempted of
            God, for God tempteth no man.” I am inclined to add: “Let no man say
            that he was tempted of the devil,” for the devil never comes into
            any man’s soul except by his permission and invitation.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">How often does the <name type="title">Bible</name>
            eulogize the man who masters his own passions? “Greater is he that
            ruleth himself than he that ruleth a city,” and the foundation of
            the mastery of cities and of states and of nations is the mastery of
            one’s self. Just as soon as the man who tries to master human
            circumstances puts <render as="italic" rend="inherit">himself</render> at the front
            of it, then begins the day of his weakness, and the day of his
            defeat. In every circumstance of life, for the child as well as for
            him who is grown, in every day and in every turn of every day, the
            question is: “Shall we rule our own spirits?” and here, set forth in
            such simple terms that the child may understand it, in the annals of
            the Holy Scripture are written the histories of men of every kind,
            whose glory was that they did master their own spirits, and through
            the whole thing lies what the Greek tragedies were never able to
            supply—the key, the thread to the labyrinth, the solution of the
            problem, the answer to the eternal question.</p>

         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">He alone can rule his own spirit who puts himself
            under the command of the Spirit of God, revealed in his Son,
               <person link-pointer-type="person">Jesus Christ</person>, our <word altform="Savior">Saviour</word>. He is the captain of our souls; he is the man from
            whose suggestions and from whose life comes the light that guideth
            every man that ever came into the world. Ah, if we can make our
            Sunday schools the blazing centers of that light, then indeed will
            the darkness of the world be dissipated. The happiness of seeing a
            great company of people gathered together in the interest of the
            Sunday school, is the happiness of knowing that there are they who
            seek light and who know that the lamp from which their spirits can
            be kindled is the lamp that glows in the Word of God.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Every Sunday school should be a place where this great
            book is not only opened, is not only studied, is not only revered,
            but is drunk of as if it were a fountain of life, is used as if it
            were the only source of inspiration and of guidance. No great nation
            can ever survive its own temptations and its own follies that does
            not indoctrinate its children in the Word of God; so that as
            schoolmaster and as governor I know that my feet must rest with the
            feet of my fellowmen upon this foundation only; for the
            righteousness of nations, like the righteousness of men, must take
            its source from these foundations of inspiration.</p>

         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I am sorry for the men who do not read the <name type="title">Bible</name> every day. I wonder why they deprive
            themselves of the strength and of the pleasure. It is one of the
            most singular books in the world, for every time you open it some
            old text that you have read a score of times suddenly beams with a
            new meaning. Evidently the mood and thought of that day, bred by the
            circumstance that you cannot analyze, has suddenly thrown its light
            upon that page and upon that passage, and there springs out upon the
            page to you something that you never saw lie upon it before. There
            is no other book that I know of of which this is true; there is no
            other book that yields its meaning so personally, that seems to fit
            itself so intimately to the very spirit that is seeking its
            guidance. And so when we teach our children we do not teach them, I
            hope, dogmatically. We must not try to make them read the Scripture
            as we read it, but merely try to bring them into such contact with
            the Scripture that it will yield its meaning to their hearts and to
            their minds. Make it their companion, make it their familiar text
            book, and the rest will take care of itself.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Who shall dare to guide another human spirit in the
            same path that he himself has trodden? Shall we not merely take
            those whom we teach to the road and say: “Here is the way of life.
            Walk ye on it; don’t follow us; don’t look to us as examples of the
            consequence of our teaching. Walk ye on it, and it will lead you to
            the City of Light.”</p>

            the American people. There are problems which will need purity of
            spirit and an integrity of purpose such as has never been called for
            before in the history of this country. I should be afraid to go
            forward if I did not believe that there lay at the foundation of all
            our schooling and of all our thought this incomparable and
            unimpeachable Word of God. If we cannot derive our strength thence,
            there is no source from which we can derive it, and so I would bid
            you go from this place, if I may, inspired once more with the
            feeling that the province of God is the foundation of affairs, and
            that only those can guide, and only those can follow, who take their
            province of God from the sources where it is authentically
            interpreted.</p>

            and interpretation of the <name type="title">Bible</name> and fewer
            elaborated Sunday school lessons. I want to say very frankly that I
            never saw a Sunday school lesson that yielded the meaning of the
            text that it was trying to interpret. If you will only give these
            little people the pure bread itself you won’t have to ask some
            inexpert chemical analyst to tell them how the bread is made up.
            There is no man with insight enough to see how the bread of life is
            made, and I wish sometimes that we could strip off these superficial
            explanations and get down to those things that sustain our spirits.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I want to urge that we get down to hard pan again,

               <person link-pointer-type="person">Thomas Carlyle</person> used to say, skeptic though he
            was, in some fundamental respects, that the best thing that ever
            happened to him was that he was obliged to learn the Shorter
            Catechism when he was a small boy and didn’t understand it, so
            thoroughly that when he grew up it kept coming out like an
            infection. He got it in his memory so that he could never get it out
            again, and suddenly when he would come face to face with some
            situation sometime that tried his soul, those wonderful definitions
            of the Shorter Catechism would stare him in the face, and he would
            know where he was. You can’t explain the Shorter Catechism to
            anybody under twenty-one successfully. Don’t try to. Get it into
            their blood, and then it will come out sometime, and hold them like
            a monitor whom they cannot avoid, and similarly with the Word of
            God. Don’t cheapen it with your explanations. Give it to them
            straight. It isn’t too strong meat even for babes. It will set well
            on any stomach, no matter how tender.</p>

            unexplained, uncheapened, and then see it work its wholesome work
            throughout the whole nature. It is very difficult, indeed, for a man
            or for a boy, who knows the Scripture, ever to get away from it. It
            haunts him like an old song. It follows him like the memory of his
            mother. It reminds him like the word of an old and revered teacher.
            It forms part of the warp and woof of his life.</p>

            President have been put into the hands of Democrats. What does the
            change mean? That is the question that is uppermost in our minds
            to-day. That is the question I am going to try to answer, in order,
            if I may, to interpret the occasion.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">It means much more than the mere success of a party.
            The success of a party means little except when the Nation is using
            that party for a large and definite purpose. No one can mistake the
            purpose for which the Nation now seeks to use the Democratic party.
            It seeks to use it to interpret a change in its own plans and point
            of view. Some old things with which we had grown familiar, and which
            had begun to creep into the very habit of our thought and of our
            lives, have altered their aspect as we have latterly looked
            critically upon them, with fresh, awakened eyes; have dropped their
            disguises and shown themselves alien and sinister. Some new things,
            as we look frankly upon them, willing to comprehend their real
            character, have come to assume the aspect of things long believed in
            and familiar, stuff of our own convictions. We have been refreshed
            by a new insight into our own life.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">We see that in many things that life is very great. It
            is incomparably great in its material aspects, in its body of
            wealth, in the diversity and sweep of its energy, in the industries
            which have been conceived and built up by the genius of individual
            men and the limitless enterprise of groups of men. It is great,
            also, very great, in its moral force. Nowhere else in the world have
            noble men and women exhibited in more striking forms the beauty and
            the energy of sympathy and helpfulness and counsel in their efforts
            to rectify wrong, alleviate suffering, and set the weak in the way
            of strength and hope. We have built up, moreover, a great system of
            government, which has stood through a long age as in many respects a
            model for those who seek to set liberty upon foundations that will
            endure against fortuitous change, against storm and accident. Our
            life contains every great thing, and contains it in rich abundance.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">But the evil has come with the good, and much fine
            gold has been corroded. With riches has come inexcusable waste. We
            have sqandered a great part of what we might have used, and have not
            stopped to conserve the exceeding bounty of nature, without which
            our genius for enterprise would have been worthless and impotent,
            scorning to be careful, shamefully prodigal as well as admirably
            efficient. We have been proud of our industrial achievements, but we
            have not hitherto stopped thoughtfully enough to count the human
            cost, the cost of lives snuffed out, of energies overtaxed and
            broken, the fearful physical and spiritual cost to the men and women
            and children upon whom the dead weight and burden of it all has
            fallen pitilessly the years through. The groans and agony of it all
            had not yet reached our ears, the solemn, moving undertone of our
            life, coming up out of the mines and factories and out of every home
            where the struggle had its intimate and familiar seat. With the
            great Government went many deep secret things which we too long
            delayed to look into and scrutinize with candid, fearless eyes. The
            great Government we loved has too often been made use of for private
            and selfish purposes, and those who used it had forgotten the
            people.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">At last a vision has been vouchsafed us of our life as
            a whole. We see the bad with the good, the debased and decadent with
            the sound and vital. With this vision we approach new affairs. Our
            duty is to cleanse, to reconsider, to restore, to correct the evil
            without impairing the good, to purify and humanize every process of
            our common life without weakening or sentimentalizing it. There has
            been something crude and heartless and unfeeling in our haste to
            succeed and be great. Our thought has been “Let every man look out
            for himself, let every generation look out for itself,” while we
            reared giant machinery which made it impossible that any but those
            who stood at the levers of control should have a chance to look out
            for themselves. We had not forgotten our morals. We remembered well
            enough that we had set up a policy which was meant to serve the
            humblest as well as the most powerful, with an eye single to the
            standards of justice and fair play, and remembered it with pride.
            But we were very heedless and in a hurry to be great.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">We have come now to the sober second thought. The
            scales of heedlessness have fallen from our eyes. We have made up
            our minds to square every process of our national life again with
            the standards we so proudly set up at the beginning and have always
            carried at our hearts. Our work is a work of restoration.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">We have itemized with some degree of particularity the
            things that ought to be altered and here are some of the chief
            items: A tariff which cuts us off from our proper part in the
            commerce of the world, violates the just principles of taxation, and
            makes the Government a facile instrument in the hands of private
            interests; a banking and currency system based upon the necessity of
            the Government to sell its bonds fifty years ago and perfectly
            adapted to concentrating cash and restricting credits; an industrial
            system which, take it on all its sides, financial as well as
            administrative, holds capital in leading strings, restricts the
            liberties and limits the opportunities of labor, and exploits
            without renewing or conserving the natural resources of the country;
            a body of agricultural activities never yet given the efficiency of
            great business undertakings or served as it should be through the
            instrumentality of science taken directly to the farm, or afforded
            the facilities of credit best suited to its practical needs;
            watercourses undeveloped, waste places unreclaimed, forests
            untended, fast disappearing without plan or prospect of renewal,
            unregarded waste heaps at every mine. We have studied as perhaps no
            other nation has the most effective means of production, but we have
            not studied cost or economy as we should either as organizers of
            industry, as statesmen, or as individuals.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Nor have we studied and perfected the means by which
            government may be put at the service of humanity, in safeguarding
            the health of the Nation, the health of its men and its women and
            its children, as well as their rights in the struggle for existence.
            This is no sentimental duty. The firm basis of government is
            justice, not pity. These are matters of justice. There can be no
            equality or opportunity, the first essential of justice in the body
            politic, if men and women and children be not shielded in their
            lives, their very vitality, from the consequences of great
            industrial and social processes which they can not alter, control,
            or singly cope with. Society must see to it that it does not itself
            crush or weaken or damage its own constituent parts. The first duty
            of law is to keep sound the society it serves. Sanitary laws, pure
            food laws, and laws determining conditions of labor which
            individuals are powerless to determine for themselves are intimate
            parts of the very business of justice and legal efficiency.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">These are some of the things we ought to do, and not
            leave the others undone, the old-fashioned, never-to-be-neglected,
            fundamental safeguarding of property and of individual right. This
            is the high enterprise of the new day: To lift everything that
            concerns our life as a Nation to the light that shines from the
            hearthfire of every man’s conscience and vision of the right. It is
            inconceivable that we should do this as partisans; it is
            inconceivable we should do it in ignorance of the facts as they are
            or in blind haste. We shall restore, not destroy. We shall deal with
            our economic system as it is and as it may be modified, not as it
            might be if we had a clean sheet of paper to write upon; and step by
            step we shall make it what it should be, in the spirit of those who
            question their own wisdom and seek counsel and knowledge, not
            shallow self-satisfaction or the excitement of excursions whither
            they can not tell. Justice, and only justice, shall always be our
            motto.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">And yet it will be no cool process of mere science.
            The Nation has been deeply stirred, stirred by a solemn passion,
            stirred by the knowledge of wrong, of ideals lost, of government too
            often debauched and made an instrument of evil. The feelings with
            which we face this new age of right and opportunity sweep across our
            heartstrings like some air out of God’s own presence, where justice
            and mercy are reconciled and the judge and the brother are one. We
            know our task to be no mere task of politics but a task which shall
            search us through and through, whether we be able to understand our
            time and the need of our people, whether we be indeed their
            spokesmen and interpreters, whether we have the pure heart to
            comprehend and the rectified will to choose our high course of
            action.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">This is not a day of triumph; it is a day of
            dedication. Here muster, not the forces of party, but the forces of
            humanity. Men’s hearts wait upon us; men’s lives hang in the
            balance; men’s hopes call upon us to say what we will do. Who shall
            live up to the great trust? Who dares fail to try? I summon all
            honest men, all patriotic, all forward-looking men, to my side. God
            helping me, I will not fail them, if they will but counsel and
            sustain me!</p>

         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I am very glad indeed to have this opportunity to
            address the two Houses directly and to verify for myself the
            impression that the President of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> is
            a person, not a mere department of the Government hailing Congress
            from some isolated island of jealous power, sending messages, not
            speaking naturally and with his own voice—that he is a human being
            trying to cooperate with other human beings in a common service.
            After this pleasant experience I shall feel quite normal in all our
            dealings with one another.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I have called the Congress together in extraordinary
            session because a duty was laid upon the party now in power at the
            recent elections which it ought to perform promptly, in order that
            the burden carried by the people under existing law may be lightened
            as soon as possible and in order, also, that the business interests
            of the country may not be kept too long in suspense as to what the
            fiscal changes are to be to which they will be required to adjust
            themselves. It is clear to the whole country that the tariff duties
            must be altered. They must be changed to meet the radical alteration
            in the conditions of our economic life which the country has
            witnessed within the last generation. While the whole face and
            method of our industrial and commercial life were being changed
            beyond recognition the tariff schedules have remained what they were
            before the change began, or have moved in the direction they were
            given when no large circumstance of our industrial development was
            what it is to-day. Our task is to square them with the actual facts.
            The sooner that is done the sooner we shall escape from suffering
            from the facts and the sooner our men of business will be free to
            thrive by the law of nature (the nature of free business) instead of
            by the law of legislation and artificial arrangement.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">We have seen tariff legislation wander very far afield
            in our day—very far indeed from the field in which our prosperity
            might have had a normal growth and stimulation. No one who looks the
            facts squarely in the face or knows anything that lies beneath the
            surface of action can fail to perceive the principles upon which
            recent tariff legislation has been based. We long ago passed beyond
            the modest notion of “protecting” the industries of the country and
            moved boldly forward to the idea that they were entitled to the
            direct patronage of the Government. For a long time—a time so long
            that the men now active in public policy hardly remember the
            conditions that preceded it—we have sought in our tariff schedules
            to give each group of manufacturers or producers what they
            themselves thought that they needed in order to maintain a
            practically exclusive market as against the rest of the world.
            Consciously or unconsciously, we have built up a set of privileges
            and exemptions from competition behind which it was easy by any,
            even the crudest, forms of combination to organize monopoly; until
            at last nothing is normal, nothing is obliged to stand the tests of
            efficiency and economy, in our world of big business, but everything
            thrives by concerted arrangement. Only new principles of action will
            save us from a final hard crystallization of monopoly and a complete
            loss of the influences that quicken enterprise and keep independent
            energy alive.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">It is plain what those principles must be. We must
            abolish everything that bears even the semblance of privilege or of
            any kind of artificial advantage, and put our business men and
            producers under the stimulation of a constant necessity to be
            efficient, economical, and enterprising, masters of competitive
            supremacy, better workers and merchants than any in the world. Aside
            from the duties laid upon articles which we do not, and probably can
            not, produce, therefore, and the duties laid upon luxuries and
            merely for the sake of the revenues they yield, the object of the
            tariff duties henceforth laid must be effective competition, the
            whetting of American wits by contest with the wits of the rest of
            the world.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">It would be unwise to move toward this end headlong,
            with reckless haste, or with strokes that cut at the very roots of
            what has grown up amongst us by long process and at our own
            invitation. It does not alter a thing to upset it and break it and
            deprive it of a chance to change. It destroys it. We must make
            changes in our fiscal laws, in our fiscal system, whose object is
            development, a more free and wholesome development, not revolution
            or upset or confusion. We must build up trade, especially foreign
            trade. We need the outlet and the enlarged field of energy more than
            we ever did before. We must build up industry as well, and must
            adopt freedom in the place of artificial stimulation only so far as
            it will build, not pull down. In dealing with the tariff the method
            by which this may be done will be a matter of judgment, exercised
            item by item. To some not accustomed to the excitements and
            responsibilities of greater freedom our methods may in some respects
            and at some points seem heroic, but remedies may be heroic and yet
            be remedies. It is our business to make sure that they are genuine
            remedies. Our object is clear. If our motive is above just challenge
            and only an occasional error of judgment is chargeable against us,
            we shall be fortunate.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">We are called upon to render the country a great
            service in more matters than one. Our responsibility should be met
            and our methods should be thorough, as thorough as moderate and well
            considered, based upon the facts as they are, and not worked out as
            if we were beginners. We are to deal with the facts of our own day,
            with the facts of no other, and to make laws which square with those
            facts. It is best, indeed it is necessary, to begin with the tariff.
            I will urge nothing upon you now at the opening of your session
            which can obscure that first object or divert our energies from that
            clearly defined duty. At a later time I may take the liberty of
            calling your attention to reforms which should press close upon the
            heels of the tariff changes, if not accompany them, of which the
            chief is the reform of our banking and currency laws; but just now I
            refrain. For the present, I put these matters on one side and think
            only of this one thing—of the changes in our fiscal system which may
            best serve to open once more the free channels of prosperity to a
            great people whom we would serve to the utmost and throughout both
            rank and file.</p>

               of the Congress</render>:</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">It is under the compulsion of what seems to me a clear
            and imperative duty that I have a second time this session sought
            the privilege of addressing you in person. I know, of course, that
            the heated season of the year is upon us, that work in these
            chambers and in the committee rooms is likely to become a burden as
            the season lengthens, and that every consideration of personal
            convenience and personal comfort, perhaps, in the cases of some of
            us, considerations of personal health even, dictate an early
            conclusion of the deliberations of the session; but there are
            occasions of public duty when these things which touch us privately
            seem very small; when the work to be done is so pressing and so
            fraught with big consequence that we know that we are not at liberty
            to weigh against it any point of personal sacrifice. We are now in
            the presence of such an occasion. It is absolutely imperative that
            we should give the business men of this country a banking and
            currency system by means of which they can make use of the freedom
            of enterprise and of individual initiative which we are about to
            bestow upon them.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">We are about to set them free; we must not leave them
            without the tools of action when they are free. We are about to set
            them free by removing the trammels of the protective tariff. Ever
            since the Civil War they have waited for this emancipation and for
            the free opportunities it will bring with it. It has been reserved
            for us to give it to them. Some fell in love, indeed, with the
            slothful security of their dependence upon the Government; some took
            advantage of the shelter of the nursery to set up a mimic mastery of
            their own within its walls. Now both the tonic and the discipline of
            liberty and maturity are to ensue. There will be some readjustments
            of purpose and point of view. There will follow a period of
            expansion and new enterprise, freshly conceived. It is for us to
            determine now whether it shall be rapid and facile and of easy
            accomplishment. This it can not be unless the resourceful business
            men who are to deal with the new circumstances are to have at hand
            and ready for use the instrumentalities and conveniences of free
            enterprise which independent men need when acting on their own
            initiative.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">It is not enough to strike the shackles from business.
            The duty of statesmanship is not negative merely. It is constructive
            also. We must show that we understand what business needs and that
            we know how to supply it. No man, however casual and superficial his
            observation of the conditions now prevailing in the country, can
            fail to see that one of the chief things business needs now, and
            will need increasingly as it gains in scope and vigor in the years
            immediately ahead of us, is the proper means by which readily to
            vitalize its credit, corporate and individual, and its originative
            brains. What will it profit us to be free if we are not to have the
            best and most accessible instrumentalities of commerce and
            enterprise? What will it profit us to be quit of one kind of
            monopoly if we are to remain in the grip of another and more
            effective kind? How are we to gain and keep the confidence of the
            business community unless we show that we know how both to aid and
            to protect it? What shall we say if we make fresh enterprise
            necessary and also make it very difficult by leaving all else except
            the tariff just as we found it? The tyrannies of business, big and
            little, lie within the field of credit. We know that. Shall we not
            act upon the knowledge? Do we not know how to act upon it? If a man
            can not make his assets available at pleasure, his assets of
            capacity and character and resource, what satisfaction is it to him
            to see opportunity beckoning to him on every hand, when others have
            the keys of credit in their pockets and treat them as all but their
            own private possession? It is perfectly clear that it is our duty to
            supply the new banking and currency system the country needs, and it
            will need it immediately more than it has ever needed it before.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The only question is, When shall we supply it—now, or
            later, after the demands shall have become reproaches that we were
            so dull and so slow? Shall we hasten to change the tariff laws and
            then be laggards about making it possible and easy for the country
            to take advantage of the change? There can be only one answer to
            that question. We must act now, at whatever sacrifice to ourselves.
            It is a duty which the circumstances forbid us to postpone. I should
            be recreant to my deepest convictions of public obligation did I not
            press it upon you with solemn and urgent insistence.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The principles upon which we should act are also
            clear. The country has sought and seen its path in this matter
            within the last few years—sees it more clearly now than it ever saw
            it before—much more clearly than when the last legislative proposals
            on the subject were made. We must have a currency, not rigid as now,
            but readily, elastically responsive to sound credit, the expanding
            and contracting credits of everyday transactions, the normal ebb and
            flow of personal and corporate dealings. Our banking laws must
            mobilize reserves; must not permit the concentration anywhere in a
            few hands of the monetary resources of the country or their use for
            speculative purposes in such volume as to hinder or impede or stand
            in the way of other more legitimate, more fruitful uses. And the
            control of the system of banking and of issue which our new laws are
            to set up must be public, not private, must be vested in the
            Government itself, so that the banks may be the instruments, not the
            masters, of business and of individual enterprise and initiative.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The committees of the Congress to which legislation of
            this character is referred have devoted careful and dispassionate
            study to the means of accomplishing these objects. They have honored
            me by consulting me. They are ready to suggest action. I have come
            to you, as the head of the Government and the responsible leader of
            the party in power, to urge action now, while there is time to serve
            the country deliberately and as we should, in a clear air of common
            counsel. I appeal to you with a deep conviction of duty. I believe
            that you share this conviction. I therefore appeal to you with
            confidence. I am at your service without reserve to play my part in
            any way you may call upon me to play it in this great enterprise of
            exigent reform which it will dignify and distinguish us to perform
            and discredit us to neglect.</p>

         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve"><render as="smallcap" rend="inherit">Friends and Fellow
            Citizens</render>: I need not tell you what the Battle of <place reg="Gettysburg, PA" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Gettysburg</place> meant. These gallant men
            in blue and gray sit all about us here. Many of them met upon this
            ground in grim and deadly struggle. Upon these famous fields and
            hillsides their comrades died about them. In their presence it were
            an impertinence to discourse upon how the battle went, how it ended,
            what it signified! But 50 years have gone by since then, and I crave
            the privilege of speaking to you for a few minutes of what those 50
            years have meant.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">What <render as="italic" rend="inherit">have</render> they meant?
            They have meant peace and union and vigor, and the maturity and
            might of a great nation. How wholesome and healing the peace has
            been! We have found one another again as brothers and comrades in
            arms, enemies no longer, generous friends rather, our battles long
            past, the quarrel forgotten—except that we shall not forget the
            splendid valor, the manly devotion of the men then arrayed against
            one another, now grasping hand and smiling into each other’s eyes.
            How complete the union has become and how dear to all of us, how
            unquestioned, how benign and majestic, as State after State has been
            added to this our great family of free men! How handsome the vigor,
            the maturity, the might of the great Nation we love with undivided
            hearts; how full of large and confident promise that a life will be
            wrought out that will crown its strength with gracious justice and
            with a happy welfare that will touch all alike with deep
            contentment! We are debtors to those 50 crowded years; they have
            made us heirs to a mighty heritage.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">But do we deem the Nation complete and finished? These
            venerable men crowding here to this famous field have set us a great
            example of devotion and utter sacrifice. They were willing to die
            that the people might live. But their task is done. Their day is
            turned into evening. They look to us to perfect what they
            established. Their work is handed on to us, to be done in another
            way, but not in another spirit. Our day is not over; it is upon us
            in full tide.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Have affairs paused? Does the Nation stand still? Is
            what the 50 years have wrought since those days of battle finished,
            rounded out, and completed? Here is a great people, great with every
            force that has ever beaten in the life blood of mankind. And it is
            secure. There is no one within its borders, there is no power among
            the nations of the earth, to make it afraid. But has it yet squared
            itself with its own great standards set up at its birth, when it
            made that first noble, naive appeal to the moral judgment of mankind
            to take notice that a government had now at last been established
            which was to serve men, not masters? It is secure in everything
            except the satisfaction that its life is right, adjusted to the
            uttermost to the standards of righteousness and humanity. The days
            of sacrifice and cleansing are not closed. We have harder things to
            do than were done in the heroic days of war, because harder to see
            clearly, requiring more vision, more calm balance of judgment, a
            more candid searching of the very springs of right.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Look around you upon the field of <place reg="Gettysburg, PA" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Gettysburg</place>! Picture the array, the
            fierce heats and agony of battle, column hurled against column,
            battery bellowing to battery! Valor? Yes! Greater no man shall see
            in war; and self-sacrifice, and loss to the uttermost; the high
            recklessness of exalted devotion which does not count the cost. We
            are made by these tragic, epic things to know what it costs to make
            a nation—the blood and sacrifice of multitudes of unknown men lifted
            to a great stature in the view of all generations by knowing no
            limit to their manly willingness to serve. In armies thus marshaled
            from the ranks of free men you will see, as it were, a nation
            embattled, the leaders and the led, and may know, if you will, how
            little except in form its action differs in days of peace from its
            action in days of war.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">May we break camp now and be at ease? Are the forces
            that fight for the Nation dispersed, disbanded, gone to their homes
            forgetful of the common cause? Are our forces disorganized, without
            constituted leaders and the might of men consciously united because
            we contend, not with armies, but with principalities and powers and
            wickedness in high places? Are we content to lie still? Does our
            union mean sympathy, our peace contentment, our vigor right action,
            our maturity self-comprehension and a clear confidence in choosing
            what we shall do? War fitted us for action, and action never ceases.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I have been chosen the leader of the Nation. I can not
            justify the choice by any qualities of my own, but so it has come
            about, and here I stand. Whom do I command? The ghostly hosts who
            fought upon these battle fields long ago and are gone? These gallant
            gentlemen stricken in years whose fighting days are over, their
            glory won? What are the orders for them, and who rallies them? I
            have in my mind another host, whom these set free of civil strife in
            order that they might work out in days of peace and settled order
            the life of a great Nation. That host is the people themselves, the
            great and the small, without class or difference of kind or race or
            origin; and undivided in interest, if we have but the vision to
            guide and direct them and order their lives aright in what we do.
            Our constitutions are their articles of enlistment. The orders of
            the day are the laws upon our statute books. What we strive for is
            their freedom, their right to lift themselves from day to day and
            behold the things they have hoped for, and so make way for still
            better days for those whom they love who are to come after them. The
            recruits are the little children crowding in. The quartermaster’s
            stores are in the mines and forests and fields, in the shops and
            factories. Every day something must be done to push the campaign
            forward; and it must be done by plan and with an eye to some great
            destiny.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">How shall we hold such thoughts in our hearts and not
            be moved? I would not have you live even to-day wholly in the past,
            but would wish to stand with you in the light that streams upon us
            now out of that great day gone by. Here is the nation God has
            builded by our hands. What shall we do with it? Who stands ready to
            act again and always in the spirit of this day of reunion and hope
            and patriotic fervor? The day of our country’s life has but
            broadened into morning. Do not put uniforms by. Put the harness of
            the present on. Lift your eyes to the great tracts of life yet to be
            conquered in the interest of righteous peace, of that prosperity
            which lies in a people’s hearts and outlasts all wars and errors of
            men. Come, let us be comrades and soldiers yet to serve our fellow
            men in quiet counsel, where the blare of trumpets is neither heard
            nor heeded and where the things are done which make blessed the
            nations of the world in peace and righteousness and love.</p>

            <render as="smallcap" rend="inherit">Gentlemen of the Congress:</render>
         </p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">It is clearly my duty to lay before you, very fully
            and without reservation, the facts concerning our present relations
            with the Republic of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Mexico</place>. The deplorable posture
            of affairs in <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Mexico</place> I need not describe, but I deem
            it my duty to speak very frankly of what this Government has done
            and should seek to do in fulfillment of its obligation to
               <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Mexico</place> herself, as a friend and neighbor, and to
            American citizens whose lives and vital interests are daily affected
            by the distressing conditions which now obtain beyond our southern
            border.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Those conditions touch us very nearly. Not merely
            because they lie at our very doors. That of course makes us more
            vividly and more constantly conscious of them, and every instinct of
            neighborly interest and sympathy is aroused and quickened by them;
            but that is only one element in the determination of our duty. We
            are glad to call ourselves the friends of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Mexico</place>, and
            we shall, I hope, have many an occasion, in happier times as well as
            in these days of trouble and confusion, to show that our friendship
            is genuine and disinterested, capable of sacrifice and every
            generous manifestation. The peace, prosperity, and contentment of
               <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Mexico</place> mean more, much more, to us than merely an
            enlarged field for our commerce and enterprise. They mean an
            enlargement of the field of self-government and the realization of
            the hopes and rights of a nation with whose best aspirations, so
            long suppressed and disappointed, we deeply sympathize. We shall yet
            prove to the Mexican people that we know how to serve them without
            first thinking how we shall serve ourselves.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">But we are not the only friends of
            <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Mexico</place>. The whole world desires her peace and
            progress; and the whole world is interested as never before.
               <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Mexico</place> lies at last where all the world looks on.
               <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Central America</place> is about to be touched by the
            great routes of the world’s trade and intercourse running free from
            ocean to ocean at the <placeRef reg="Isthmus of Panama" link-pointer-type="place">Isthmus</placeRef>. The future has much in store for
            <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Mexico</place>, as for all the States of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Central
               America</place>; but the best gifts can come to her only if she
            be ready and free to receive them and to enjoy them honorably.
               <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> in particular—America north and south and
            upon both continents—waits upon the development of
            <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Mexico</place>; and that development can be sound and lasting
            only if it be the product of a genuine freedom, a just and ordered
            government founded upon law. Only so can it be peaceful or fruitful
            of the benefits of peace. <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Mexico</place> has a great and
            enviable future before her, if only she choose and attain the paths
            of honest constitutional government.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The present circumstances of the Republic, I deeply
            regret to say, do not seem to promise even the foundations of such a
            peace. We have waited many months, months full of peril and anxiety,
            for the conditions there to improve, and they have not improved.
            They have grown worse, rather. The territory in some sort controlled
            by the provisional authorities at <place reg="Mexico City, Mexico" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Mexico City</place> has grown smaller, not larger. The prospect
            of the pacification of the country, even by arms, has seemed to grow
            more and more remote; and its pacification by the authorities at
               <placeRef reg="Mexico City, Mexico" link-pointer-type="place">the capital</placeRef> is
            evidently impossible by any other means than force. Difficulties
            more and more entangle those who claim to constitute the legitimate
            government of the Republic. They have not made good their claim in
            fact. Their successes in the field have proved only temporary. War
            and disorder, devastation and confusion, seem to threaten to become
            the settled fortune of the distracted country. As friends we could
            wait no longer for a solution which every week seemed further away.
            It was our duty at least to volunteer our good offices—to offer to
            assist, if we might, in effecting some arrangement which would bring
            relief and peace and set up a universally acknowledged political
            authority there.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Accordingly, I took the liberty of sending the <person refurl="x4002220" reg="John Lind" link-pointer-type="person">Hon.
               John Lind</person>, formerly governor of
            <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Minnesota</place>, as my personal spokesman and
            representative, to the <place reg="Mexico City, Mexico" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">City of
               Mexico</place>, with <render as="italic" rend="inherit">the following
                  instructions:<space dim="vertical" extent="2" units="em"/></render></p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Press very earnestly upon the attention of those who
            are now exercising authority or wielding influence in
            <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Mexico</place> the following considerations and advice:</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The Government of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place>
            does not feel at liberty any longer to stand inactively by while it
            becomes daily more and more evident that no real progress is being
            made towards the establishment of a government at the <place reg="Mexico City, Mexico" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">City of Mexico</place> which the
            country will obey and respect.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The Government of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place>
            does not stand in the same case with the other great Governments of
            the world in respect of what is happening or what is likely to
            happen in <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Mexico</place>. We offer our good offices, not only
            because of our genuine desire to play the part of a friend, but also
            because we are expected by the powers of the world to act as
               <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Mexico’s</place> nearest friend.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">We wish to act in these circumstances in the spirit of
            the most earnest and disinterested friendship. It is our purpose in
            whatever we do or propose in this perplexing and distressing
            situation not only to pay the most scrupulous regard to the
            sovereignty and independence of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Mexico</place>—that we take
            as a matter of course to which we are bound by every obligation of
            right and honor—but also to give every possible evidence that we act
            in the interest of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Mexico</place> alone, and not in the
            interest of any person or body of persons who may have personal or
            property claims in <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Mexico</place> which they may feel that
            they have the right to press. We are seeking to counsel
               <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Mexico</place> for her own good and in the interest of her
            own peace, and not for any other purpose whatever. The Government of
            the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> would deem itself discredited if it
            had any selfish or ulterior purpose in transactions where the peace
            happiness, and prosperity of a whole people are involved. It is
            acting as its friendship for <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Mexico</place>, not as any
            selfish interest, dictates.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The present situation in <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Mexico</place> is
            incompatible with the fulfillment of international obligations on

               <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Mexico</place> herself, and with the maintenance of
            tolerable political and economic conditions in <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Central
               America</place>. It is upon no common occasion, therefore, that
            the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> offers her counsel and assistance.
            All <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> cries out for a settlement.</p>

            good judgment, and made clear to the authorities at the <place reg="Mexico City, Mexico" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">City of Mexico</place> not only the
            purpose of his visit but also the spirit in which it had been
            undertaken. But the proposals he submitted were rejected, in a note
            the full text of which I take the liberty of laying before you.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I am led to believe that they were rejected partly
            because the authorities at <place reg="Mexico City, Mexico" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Mexico
               City</place> had been grossly misinformed and misled upon two
            points. They did not realize the spirit of the American people in
            this matter, their earnest friendliness and yet sober determination
            that some just solution be found for the Mexican difficulties; and
            they did not believe that the present administration spoke, through
               <person refurl="x4002220" reg="John Lind" link-pointer-type="person">Mr. Lind</person>, for the people of
            the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place>. The effect of this unfortunate
            misunderstanding on their part is to leave them singularly isolated
            and without friends who can effectually aid them. So long as the
            misunderstanding continues we can only await the time of their
            awakening to a realization of the actual facts. We can not thrust
            our good offices upon them. The situation must be given a little
            more time to work itself out in the new circumstances; and I believe
            that only a little while will be necessary. For the circumstances
            are new. The rejection of our friendship makes them new and will
            inevitably bring its own alterations in the whole aspect of affairs.
            The actual situation of the authorities at <place reg="Mexico City, Mexico" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Mexico City</place> will presently be
            revealed.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Meanwhile, what is it our duty to do? Clearly,
            everything that we do must be rooted in patience and done with calm
            and disinterested deliberation. Impatience on our part would be
            childish, and would be fraught with every risk of wrong and folly.
            We can afford to exercise the self-restraint of a really great
            nation which realizes its own strength and scorns to misuse it. It
            was our duty to offer our active assistance. It is now our duty to
            show what true neutrality will do to enable the people of
               <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Mexico</place> to set their affairs in order again and
            wait for a further opportunity to offer our friendly counsels. The
            door is not closed against the resumption, either upon the
            initiative of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Mexico</place> or upon our own, of the effort
            to bring order out of the confusion by friendly cooperative action,
            should fortunate occasion offer.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">While we wait the contest of the rival forces will
            undoubtedly for a little while be sharper than ever, just because it
            will be plain that an end must be made of the existing situation,
            and that very promptly; and with the increased activity of the
            contending factions will come, it is to be feared, increased danger
            to the noncombatants in <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Mexico</place> as well as to those
            actually in the field of battle. The position of outsiders is always
            particularly trying and full of hazard where there is civil strife
            and a whole country is upset. We should earnestly urge all Americans
            to leave <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Mexico</place> at once, and should assist them to
            get away in every way possible—not because we would mean to slacken
            in the least our efforts to safeguard their lives and their
            interests, but because it is imperative that they should take no
            unnecessary risks when it is physically possible for them to leave
            the country. We should let every one who assumes to exercise
            authority in any part of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Mexico</place> know in the most
            unequivocal way that we shall vigilantly watch the fortunes of those
            Americans who can not get away, and shall hold those responsible for
            their sufferings and losses to a definite reckoning. That can be and
            will be made plain beyond the possibility of a misunderstanding.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">For the rest, I deem it my duty to exercise the
            authority conferred upon me by the law of <date value="1912-03-14">March 14, 1912</date>, to see to it that neither side to the
            struggle now going on in <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Mexico</place> receive any
            assistance from this side the border. I shall follow the best
            practice of nations in the matter of neutrality by forbidding the
            exportation of arms or munitions of war of any kind from the
               <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> to any part of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Republic
               of Mexico</place>—a policy suggested by several interesting
            precedents and certainly dictated by many manifest considerations of
            practical expediency. We can not in the circumstances be the
            partisans of either party to the contest that now distracts
               <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Mexico</place>, or constitute ourselves the virtual umpire
            between them.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I am happy to say that several of the great
            Governments of the world have given this Government their generous
            moral support in urging upon the provisional authorities at the
               <place reg="Mexico City, Mexico" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">City of Mexico</place> the
            acceptance of our proffered good offices in the spirit in which they
            were made. We have not acted in this matter under the ordinary
            principles of international obligation. All the world expects us in
            such circumstances to act as <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Mexico’s</place> nearest friend
            and intimate adviser. This is our immemorial relation towards her.
            There is nowhere any serious question that we have the moral right
            in the case or that we are acting in the interest of a fair
            settlement and of good government, not for the promotion of some
            selfish interest of our own. If further motive were necessary than
            our own good will towards a sister <placeRef reg="Mexico" link-pointer-type="place">Republic</placeRef> and our own deep concern to see peace and order
            prevail in <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Central America</place>, this consent of mankind
            to what we are attempting, this attitude of the great nations of the
            world towards what we may attempt in dealing with this distressed
            people at our doors, should make us feel the more solemnly bound to
            go to the utmost length of patience and forbearance in this painful
            and anxious business. The steady pressure of moral force will before
            many days break the barriers of pride and prejudice down, and we
            shall triumph as <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Mexico’s</place> friends sooner than we
            could triumph as her enemies—and how much more handsomely, with how
            much higher and finer satisfactions of conscience and of honor!</p>

            instant, pursuant to telegraphic instructions from his Government,
            the chargé d’affaires ad interim of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States of
               America</place> verbally informed <person link-pointer-type="person">Mr. Manuel Garza
            Aldape</person>, then in charge of the department of foreign
            affairs, of your expected arrival in this <placeRef reg="Mexico" link-pointer-type="place">Republic</placeRef> with a mission of peace. As fortunately
            neither then nor to-day has there existed a state of war between the
               <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States of America</place> and the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United
               Mexican States</place>, my Government was very much surprised to
            learn that your mission near us should be referred to as one of
            peace. This brought forth the essential condition which my
            Government ventured to demand in its unnumbered note of the 6th
            instant addressed to the aforesaid chargé d’affaires—“that if you do
            not see fit to properly establish your official character” your
            sojourn could not be pleasing to us according to the meaning which
            diplomatic usage gives to this word.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Fortunately, from the first interview I had the
            pleasure to have with you, your character as confidential agent of
            your Government was fully established, inasmuch as the letter you
            had the kindness to show me, though impersonally addressed, was
            signed by the <personRef refurl="x4000418" reg="Woodrow Wilson" link-pointer-type="person">President of the United
            States</personRef>, for whom we entertain the highest respect.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">It is not essential at this time, <personRef refurl="x4002220" reg="John Lind" link-pointer-type="person">Mr.
               Confidential Agent</personRef>, that I should recall the whole of
            our first conversation. I will say, however, that I found you to be
            a well-informed man and animated by the sincerest wishes that the
            unfortunate tension of the present relations between your Government
            and mine should reach a prompt and satisfactory solution.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">During our second interview, which, like the first one
            of the 14th instant, was held at my private (<ref refurl="e88387219130827886_1" link-pointer-type="Note">
               <render as="superscript" rend="inherit">1</render>
            </ref>), you saw fit, after all intent, honest and frank exchange of
            opinion concerning the attitudes of our respective Governments which
            did not lead us to any decision, to deliver to me the note
            containing the instructions, also signed by the <personRef refurl="x4000418" reg="Woodrow Wilson" link-pointer-type="person">President of the United States</personRef>. Duly authorized by
            the <personRef refurl="x4002421" reg="Victoriano Huerta" link-pointer-type="person">President of the Republic</personRef>,
            pursuant to the unanimous approval of the Cabinet, which was
            convened for the purpose, I have the honor to make a detailed reply
            to such instructions.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The Government of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Mexico</place> has paid due
            attention to the advice and considerations expressed by the
            Government of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place>; has done this on
            account of three principal reasons: First, because, as stated
            before, <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Mexico</place> entertains the highest respect for the
            personality of <person refurl="x4000418" reg="Woodrow Wilson" link-pointer-type="person">His Excellency Woodrow
            Wilson</person>; second, because certain European and American
            Governments, with which <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Mexico</place> cultivates the closest
            relations of international amity, having in a most delicate,
            respectful way, highly gratifying to us, made use of their good
            offices to the end that <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Mexico</place> should accord you a
            hearing, inasmuch as you were the bearer of a private mission from
            the <personRef refurl="x4000418" reg="Woodrow Wilson" link-pointer-type="person">President of the United
            States</personRef>; and, third, because <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Mexico</place> was
            anxious, not so much to justify its attitude before the inhabitants
            of the <placeRef reg="Mexico" link-pointer-type="place">Republic</placeRef> in the present
            emergency, the great majority of whom and by means of imposing and
            orderly manifestations, have signified their adhesion and approval,
            as to demonstrate in every way the justice of its cause.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The imputation contained in the first paragraph of
            your instructions that no progress has been made toward establishing
            in the <placeRef reg="Mexico City, Mexico" link-pointer-type="place">capital of
            Mexico</placeRef> a Government that may enjoy the respect and
            obedience of the Mexican people is unfounded. In contradiction with
            their gross imputation, which is not supported by any proofs,
            principally because there are none, it affords me pleasure to refer,
               <personRef refurl="x4002220" reg="John Lind" link-pointer-type="person">Mr. Confidential Agent</personRef>, to
            the following facts which abound in evidence and which to a certain
            extent must be known to you by direct observation. The
               <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Mexican Republic</place>, <personRef refurl="x4002220" reg="John Lind" link-pointer-type="person">Mr. Confidential
            Agent</personRef>, is formed by 27 States, 3 Territories, and 1
            Federal District, in which the supreme power of the
               <placeRef link-pointer-type="place">Republic</placeRef> has its seat. Of these 27 States,
            18 of them, the 3 Territories, and the Federal District (making a
            total of 22 political entities) are under the absolute control of
            the present Government, which, aside from the above, exercises its
            authority over almost every port in the <placeRef reg="Mexico" link-pointer-type="place">Republic</placeRef> and consequently over the customhouses
            therein established. Its southern frontier is open and at peace.
            Moreover, my Government has an army of 80,000 men in the field with
            no other purpose than to insure complete peace in the <placeRef reg="Mexico" link-pointer-type="place">Republic</placeRef>, the only national aspiration
            and solemn promise of the present provisional <personRef refurl="x4002421" reg="Victoriano Huerta" link-pointer-type="person">President</personRef>. The above is
            sufficient to exclude any doubt that my Government is worthy of the
            respect and obedience of the Mexican people, because the latter’s
            consideration has been gained at the cost of the greatest sacrifice
            and in spite of the most evil influences.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">My Government fails to understand what the Government
            of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States of America</place> means by saying that
            it does not find itself in the same case with reference to the other
            nations of the earth concerning what is happening and is likely to
            happen in <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Mexico</place>. The conditions of
            <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Mexico</place> at the present time are unfortunately neither
            doubtful nor secret; it is afflicted with an internal strife which
            has been raging almost three years, and which I can only classify in
            these lines as a fundamental mistake. With reference to what might
            happen in <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Mexico</place> neither you, <personRef refurl="x4002220" reg="John Lind" link-pointer-type="person">Mr.
               Confidential Agent</personRef>, nor I nor anyone else can
            prognosticate, because no assertion is possible on incidents which
            have not occurred. On the other hand, my Government greatly
            appreciates the good offices tendered to it by the Government of the
               <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States of America</place> in the present
            circumstances; it recognizes that they are inspired by the noble
            desire to act as a friend as well as by the wishes of all the other
            Governments which expect the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> to act as
               <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Mexico’s</place> nearest friend. But if such good offices
            are to be of the character of those now tendered to us we should
            have to decline them in the most categorical and definite manner.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Inasmuch as the Government of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United
            States</place> is willing to act in the most disinterested
            friendship, it will be difficult for it to find a more propitious
            opportunity than the following: If it should only watch that no
            material and monetary assistance is given to rebels who find refuge,
            conspire, and provide themselves with arms and food on the other
            side of the border; if it should demand from its minor and local
            authorities the strictest observance of the neutrality laws, I
            assure you, <personRef refurl="x4002220" reg="John Lind" link-pointer-type="person">Mr. Confidential Agent</personRef>,
            that the complete pacification of this <placeRef reg="Mexico" link-pointer-type="place">Republic</placeRef> would be accomplished within a relatively
            short time.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I intentionally abstain from replying to the allusion
            that it is the purpose of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States of
            America</place> to show the greatest respect for the sovereignty and
            independence of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Mexico</place>, because, <personRef refurl="x4002220" reg="John Lind" link-pointer-type="person">Mr.
               Confidential Agent</personRef>, there are matters which not even
            from the standpoint of the idea itself could be given an answer in
            writing.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve"><person refurl="x4000418" reg="Woodrow Wilson" link-pointer-type="person">His Excellency, Mr. Wilson</person>,
            is laboring under a serious delusion when he declares that the
            present situation of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Mexico</place> is incompatible with the
            compliance of her international obligations, with the development of
            its own civilization, and with the required maintenance of certain
            political and economical conditions tolerable in <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Central
               America</place>. Strongly backing that there is a mistake,
            because to this date no charge has been made by any foreign
            Government accusing us of the above lack of compliance, we are
            punctually meeting all of our credits; we are still maintaining
            diplomatic missions cordially accepted in almost all the countries
            of the world, and we continue to be invited to all kinds of
            international congresses and conferences. With regard to our
            interior development, the following proof is sufficient, to wit, a
            contract has just been signed with Belgian capitalists which means
            to <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Mexico</place> the construction of something like 5,000
            kilometers of railway. In conclusion, we fail to see the evil
            results, which are prejudicial only to ourselves, felt in
               <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Central America</place> by our present domestic war. In
            one thing I do agree with you, <personRef refurl="x4002220" reg="John Lind" link-pointer-type="person">Mr. Confidential
            Agent</personRef>, and it is that the whole of
            <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> is clamoring for a prompt solution of our
            disturbances, this being a very natural sentiment if it is borne in
            mind that a country which was prosperous only yesterday has been
            suddenly caused to suffer a great internal misfortune.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Consequently <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Mexico</place> can not for one
            moment take into consideration the four conditions which <person refurl="x4000418" reg="Woodrow Wilson" link-pointer-type="person">His Excellency Mr. Wilson</person> has been pleased to propose
            through your honorable and worthy channel. I must give you the
            reasons for it: An immediate suspension of the struggle in
               <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Mexico</place>, a definite armistice “solemnly constructed
            and scrupulously observed” is not possible, as to do this it would
            be necessary that there should be some one capable of proposing it
            without causing a profound offense to civilization, to the many
            bandits who, under this or that pretext, are marauding toward the
            south and committing the most outrageous depredations; and I know of
            no country in the world, the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> included,
            which may have ever dared to enter into agreement or to propose an
            armistice to individuals who, perhaps on account of a physiological
            accident, can be found all over the world beyond the pale of the
            divine and human laws. Bandits, <personRef refurl="x4002220" reg="John Lind" link-pointer-type="person">Mr. Confidential
            Agent</personRef>, are not admitted to armistice; the first action
            against them is one of correction, and when this, unfortunately,
            fails their lives must be severed for the sake of the biological and
            fundamental principle then the useful sprouts should grow and
            fructify.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">With reference to the rebels who style themselves
            “Constitutionalists,” one of the representatives of whom has been
            given an ear by Members of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> Senate,
            what could there be more gratifying to us than if convinced of the
            precipice to which we are being dragged by the resentment of their
            defeat, in a moment of reaction they would depose their rancor and
            add their strength to ours, so that all together we would undertake
            the great and urgent task of national reconstruction? Unfortunately
            they do not avail themselves of the amnesty law enacted by the
            provisional government immediately after its inauguration, but on
            the contrary, well-known rebels holding elective positions in the
               <placeRef reg="Mexico City, Mexico" link-pointer-type="place">capital of the
            Republic</placeRef> or profitable employments, left the country
            without molestation, notwithstanding the information which the
            Government had that they were going to foreign lands to work against
            its interests, many of whom have taken upon themselves the
            unfortunate task of exposing the mysteries and infirmities from
            which we are suffering, the same as any other human congregations.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Were we to agree with them to the armistice suggested,
            they would, ipso facto, recognize their belligerency, and this is
            something which can not be done for many reasons which can not
            escape the perspicacity of the Government of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United
               States of America</place>, which to this day, and publicly, at
            least, has classed them as rebels just the same as we have. And it
            is an accepted doctrine that no armistice can be concerted with
            rebels.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The assurance asked of my Government that it should
            promptly convene to free elections is the most evident proof and the
            most unequivocal concession that the Government of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United
               States</place> considers it legally and solidly constituted and
            that it is exercising, like all those of its class, acts of such
            importance as to indicate the perfect civil operation of a sovereign
            nation. Inasmuch as our laws already provide such assurance, there
            is no fear that the latter may not be observed during the coming
            elections, and while the present Government is of a provisional
            character it will cede its place to the definite Government which
            may be elected by the people.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The request that <person refurl="x4002421" reg="Victoriano Huerta" link-pointer-type="person">Gen.
               Victoriano Huerta</person> should agree not to appear as a
            candidate for the Presidency of the <placeRef reg="Mexico" link-pointer-type="place">Republic</placeRef> in the coming elections can not be taken into
            consideration, because, aside from its strange and unwarranted
            character, there is a risk that the same might be interpreted as a
            matter of personal dislike. This point can only be decided by
            Mexican public opinion when it may be expressed at the polls.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The pledge that all parties should agree beforehand to
            the results of the election and to cooperate in the most loyal
            manner to support and organize the new administration is something
            to be tacitly supposed and desired, and that the experience of what
            this internal strife means to us in loss of life and the destruction
            of property will cause all contending political factions to abide by
            the results; but it would be extemporaneous to make any assertion in
            this respect, even by the most experienced countries in civil
            matters, inasmuch as no one can forecast or foresee the errors and
            excesses which men are likely to commit, especially under the
            influence of political passion. We hasten to signify our
            appreciation to the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States of America</place> because
            they agree from to-day to recognize and aid the future which we, the
            Mexican people, may elect to rule our destinies. On the other hand,
            we greatly deplore the present tension in our relations with your
            country, a tension which has been produced without
            <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Mexico</place> having afforded the slightest cause therefor.
            The legality of the government of <person refurl="x4002421" reg="Victoriano Huerta" link-pointer-type="person">Gen.
            Huerta</person> can not be disputed. Article 85 of our political
            constitution provides:</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve"><space dim="vertical" extent="2" units="em"/>If at the beginning
            of a constitutional term neither the President nor the Vice
            President elected present themselves, or if the election had not
            been held and the results thereof declared by the 1st of December,
            nevertheless, the President whose term has expired will cease in his
            functions, and the secretary for foreign affairs shall immediately
            take charge of the Executive power in the capacity of provisional
            President; and if there should be no secretary for foreign affairs,
            or if he should be incapacitated, the Presidency shall devolve on
            one of the other secretaries pursuant to the order provided by the
            law establishing their number. The same procedure shall be followed
            when, in the case of the absolute or temporary absence of the
            President the Vice President fails to appear, when on leave of
            absence from his post if he should be discharging his duties, and
            when in the course of his term the absolute absence of both
            functionaries should occur.<space dim="vertical" extent="2" units="em"/></p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Now, then, the facts which occurred are the following:
            The resignation of <person refurl="x4002874" reg="Francisco I. Madero" link-pointer-type="person">Francisco I.
               Madero</person>, constitutional President, and <person link-pointer-type="person">Jose Maria
               Pino Suarez</person>, constitutional Vice President of the
               <placeRef reg="Mexico" link-pointer-type="place">Republic</placeRef>. These resignations
            having been accepted, <person link-pointer-type="person">Pedro Lascurain</person>, minister for
            foreign affairs, took charge by operation of law of the vacant
            executive power, appointing, as he had the power to do, <person refurl="x4002421" reg="Victoriano Huerta" link-pointer-type="person">Gen. Victoriano Huerta</person> to the
            post of minister of the interior. As <person reg="Pedro Lascurain" link-pointer-type="person">Mr. Lascurain</person> soon afterwards resigned, and as his
            resignation was immediately accepted by Congress, <person refurl="x4002421" reg="Victoriano Huerta" link-pointer-type="person">Gen. Victoriano Huerta</person> took
            charge of the executive power, also by operation of law, with the
            provisional character and under the constitutional promise already
            complied with to issue a call for special elections. As will be
            seen, the point of issue is exclusively one of constitutional law in
            which no foreign nation, no matter how powerful and respectable it
            may be, should mediate in the least.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Moreover, my Government considers that at the present
            time the recognition of the Government of <person refurl="x4002421" reg="Victoriano Huerta" link-pointer-type="person">Gen.
            Huerta</person> by that of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States of
            America</place> is not concerned, inasmuch as facts which exist on
            their own account are not and can not be susceptible of recognition.
            The only thing which is being discussed is a suspension of relations
            as abnormal and without reason; abnormal, because the <personRef reg="Henry L. Wilson" link-pointer-type="person">ambassador of the United States of
            America</personRef>, in his high diplomatic investiture and
            appearing as dean of the foreign diplomatic corps accredited to the
            Government of the <placeRef reg="Mexico" link-pointer-type="place">Republic</placeRef>,
            congratulated <person refurl="x4002421" reg="Victoriano Huerta" link-pointer-type="person">Gen. Huerta</person> upon his
            elevation to the Presidency, continued to correspond with this
            department by means of diplomatic notes, and on his departure left
            the first secretary of the embassy of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States of
               America</place> as chargé d’affaires ad interim, and the latter
            continues here in the free exercise of his functions; and without
            reason, because, I repeat, we have not given the slightest pretext.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The <personRef refurl="x4002220" reg="John Lind" link-pointer-type="person">confidential agent</personRef> may
            believe that solely because of the sincere esteem in which the
            people and the Government of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States of
            America</place> are held by the people and Government of
               <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Mexico</place>, and because of the consideration which it
            has for all friendly nations (and especially in this case for those
            which have offered their good offices), my Government consented to
            take into consideration, and to answer as briefly as the matter
            permits, the representations of which you are the bearer. Otherwise,
            it would have rejected them immediately because of their humiliating
            and unusual character, hardly admissible even in a treaty of peace
            after a victory, inasmuch as in a like case any nation which in the
            least respects itself would do likewise. It is because my Government
            has confidence in that when the justice of its cause is reconsidered
            with serenity and from a lofty point of view by the present
               <personRef refurl="x4000418" reg="Woodrow Wilson" link-pointer-type="person">President of the United States of
               America</personRef>, whose sense of morality and uprightness are
            beyond question, that he will withdraw from his attitude and will
            contribute to the renewal of still firmer bases for the relations of
            sincere friendship and good understanding forcibly imposed upon us
            throughout the centuries by our geographical nearness, something
            which neither of us can change, even though we would so desire, by
            our mutual interests and by our share of activity in the common
            sense of prosperity, welfare, and culture, in regard to which we are
            pleased to acknowledge that you are enviably ahead of us.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">With reference to the final part of the instructions
            of <person refurl="x4000418" reg="Woodrow Wilson" link-pointer-type="person">President Wilson</person>, which I beg
            to include herewith and which say, “If <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Mexico</place> can
            suggest any better way in which to show our friendship, serve the
            people of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Mexico</place>, and meet our international
            obligations, we are more than willing to consider the suggestion,”
            that final part causes me to propose the following equally decorous
            arrangement: One, that our ambassador be received in <place reg="Washington, DC" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Washington</place>; two, that the
               <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States of America</place> send us a new ambassador
            without previous conditions.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">And all this threatening and distressing situation
            will have reached a happy conclusion; mention will not be made of
            the causes which might carry us, if the tension persists, to no one
            knows what incalculable extremities for two peoples who have the
            unavoidable obligation to continue being friends, provided, of
            course, that this friendship is based upon mutual respect, which is
            indispensable between two sovereign entities wholly equal before law
            and justice.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">In conclusion, permit me, <personRef refurl="x4002220" reg="John Lind" link-pointer-type="person">Mr. Confidential
            Agent</personRef>, to reiterate to you the assurances of my perfect

         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">“Gentlemen, I feel a very peculiar pleasure in what I have just done by way of taking part in the completion of a great piece of business.  It is a pleasure which is very hard to express in words which are adequate to express the feeling, because the feeling that I have is that we have done the rank and file of the people of this country a great service. It is hard to speak of these things without see<del status="unremarkable">i</del><add>m</add>ing to go off into campaign eloquence, but that is not my feeling. It is one very profound, a feeling of profound gratitude that, working with the splendid men who have carried this thing through with studious attention and doing justice all ’round, I should have had part in serving the people of this country as we have been striving to serve them <sic corr="ever">every</sic> since I can remember.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">“I have had the accomplishment of something like this at heart ever since I was a boy, and I know men standing around me who can say the same thing, who have been waiting to see the things done which it was necessary to do in order that there might be justice in the <place reg="United States of America" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place>. And so it is a solemn moment that brings such a business to a conclusion, and I hope I will not be thought to be demanding too much of myself or of my colleagues when I say that this, great as it is, is the accomplishment of only half the journey. We have set the business of this country free from those conditions which have made monopoly not only possible, but in a sense easy and natural. But there is no use taking away the conditions of monopoly if we do not take away also the power to create monopoly; and that is a financial rather than a merely circumstantial and economic power. The power to control and guide and direct the credits of the country is the power to say who shall and who shall not build up the industries of the country, in which direction they shall be built, and in which direction they shall not be built. We are now about to take the second step, which will be the final step in setting the business of this country free. That is what we shall do in the currency bill, which the House has already passed and which I have the utmost confidence the Senate will pass much sooner than some pessimistic individuals believe. Because the question, now that this piece of work is done, will arise all over the country. ‘For what do we wait? Why should we wait to crown ourselves with consummate honor? Are we so self-denying that we do wish to complete success?’ I was quoting the other day <del status="unremarkable">s</del><add>t</add>o some of my colleagues in the Senate those lines from <person reg="William Shakespeare" link-pointer-type="person">Shakespeare</person>’s <name type="title">Henry V</name>, which have always appealed to me, ‘If it be a sin to covet honor, then am I the most offending soul alive,’ and I am happy to say that I do not covet it for myself alone. I covet it with equal ardor for the men who are associated with me, and the honor is going to come from them. I am their associate. I can only complete the work which they do. I can only counsel when they ask for my counsel. I can come in only when the last stages of the business are reached. And I covet this honor for them quite as much as I covet it for myself; and I covet it for the great party of which I am a member, because that party is not honorable unless it redeem its name and serve the people of the <place reg="United States of America" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place>.</p>

            Gentlemen:</render>
         </p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">No American could stand in this place to-day and think
            of the circumstances which we are come together to celebrate without
            being most profoundly stirred. There has come over me since I sat
            down here a sense of deep solemnity, because it has seemed to me
            that I saw ghosts crowding—a great assemblage of spirits, no longer
            visible, but whose influence we still feel as we feel the molding
            power of history itself. The men who sat in this hall, to whom we
            now look back with a touch of deep sentiment, were men of flesh and
            blood, face to face with extremely difficult problems. The
            population of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> then was hardly three
            times the present population of the city of <place reg="Philadelphia, PA" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Philadelphia</place>, and yet that was a
            Nation as this is a Nation, and the men who spoke for it were
            setting their hands to a work which was to last, not only that their
            people might be happy, but that an example might be lifted up for
            the instruction of the rest of the world.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I like to read the quaint old accounts such as
               <person link-pointer-type="person">Mr. Day</person> has read to us this afternoon. Strangers
            came then to <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> to see what the young people
            that had sprung up here were like, and they found men in counsel who
            knew how to construct governments. They found men deliberating here
            who had none of the appearance of novices, none of the hesitation of
            men who did not know whether the work they were doing was going to
            last or not; men who addressed themselves to a problem of
            construction as familiarly as we attempt to carry out the traditions
            of a Government established these 137 years.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I feel to-day the compulsion of these men, the
            compulsion of examples which were set up in this place. And of what
            do their examples remind us? They remind us not merely of public
            service but of public service shot through with principle and honor.
            They were not histrionic men. They did not say—<space dim="vertical" extent="1" units="em"/></p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Look upon us as upon those who shall hereafter be
               illustrious.<space dim="vertical" extent="1" units="em"/></p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">They said:<space dim="vertical" extent="1" units="em"/></p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Look upon us who are doing the first free work of
            constitutional liberty in the world, and who must do it in soberness
            and truth, or it will not last.<space dim="vertical" extent="1" units="em"/></p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Politics, ladies and gentlemen, is made up in just
            about equal parts of comprehension and sympathy. No man ought to go
            into politics who does not comprehend the task that he is going to
            attack. He may comprehend it so completely that it daunts him, that
            he doubts whether his own spirit is stout enough and his own mind
            able enough to attempt its great undertakings, but unless he
            comprehend it he ought not to enter it. After he has comprehended
            it, there should come into his mind those profound impulses of
            sympathy which connect him with the rest of mankind, for politics is
            a business of interpretation, and no men are fit for it who do not
            see and seek more than their own advantage and interest.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">We have stumbled upon many unhappy circumstances in
            the hundred years that have gone by since the event that we are
            celebrating. Almost all of them have come from self-centered men,
            men who saw in their own interest the interest of the country, and
            who did not have vision enough to read it in wider terms, in the
            universal terms of equity and justice and the rights of mankind. I
            hear a great many people at Fourth of July celebrations laud the
            Declaration of Independence who in between Julys shiver at the plain
            language of our bills of rights. The Declaration of Independence
            was, indeed, the first audible breath of liberty, but the substance
            of liberty is written in such documents as the declaration of rights
            attached, for example, to the first constitution of
            <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Virginia</place> which was a model for the similar documents
            read elsewhere into our great fundamental charters. That document
            speaks in very plain terms. The men of that generation did not
            hesitate to say that every people has a right to choose its own
            forms of government—not once, but as often as it pleases—and to
            accommodate those forms of government to its existing interests and
            circumstances. Not only to establish but to alter is the fundamental
            principle of self-government.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">We are just as much under compulsion to study the
            particular circumstances of our own day as the gentlemen were who
            sat in this hall and set us precedents, not of what to do but of how
            to do it. Liberty inheres in the circumstances of the day. Human
            happiness consists in the life which human being are leading at the
            time that they live. I can feed my memory as happily upon the
            circumstances of the revolutionary and constitutional period as you
            can, but I can not feed all my purposes with them in <place reg="Washington, DC" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Washington</place> now. Every day problems
            arise which wear some new phase and aspect, and I must fall back, if
            I would serve my conscience, upon those things which are fundamental
            rather than upon those things which are superficial, and ask myself
            this question, How are you going to assist in some small part to
            give the American people and, by example, the peoples of the world
            more liberty, more happiness, more substantial prosperity; and how
            are you going to make that prosperity a common heritage instead of a
            selfish possession? I came here to-day partly in order to feed my
            own spirit. I did not come in compliment. When I was asked to come I
            knew immediately upon the utterance of the invitation that I had to
            come, that to be absent would be as if I refused to drink once more
            at the original fountains of inspiration for our own Government.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The men of the day which we now celebrate had a very
            great advantage over us, ladies and gentlemen, in this one
            particular: Life was simple in <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> then. All men
            shared the same circumstances in almost equal degree. We think of
               <person refurl="x4000491" reg="George Washington" link-pointer-type="person">Washington</person>, for example, as
            an aristocrat, as a man separated by training, separated by family
            and neighborhood tradition, from the ordinary people of the rank and
            file of the country. Have you forgotten the personal history of
               <person refurl="x4000491" reg="George Washington" link-pointer-type="person">George Washington</person>? Do you not
            know that he struggled as poor boys now struggle for a meager and
            imperfect education; that he worked at his surveyor’s tasks in the
            lonely forests; that he knew all the roughness, all the hardships,
            all the adventure, all the variety of the common life of that day;
            and that if he stood a little stiffly in this place, if he looked a
            little aloof, it was because life had dealt hardly with him? All his
            sinews had been stiffened by the rough work of making
            <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place>. He was a man of the people, whose touch had
            been with them since the day he saw the light first in the old
            Dominion of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Virginia</place>. And the men who came after him,
            men, some of whom had drunk deep at the sources of philosophy and of
            study, were, nevertheless, also men who on this side of the water
            knew no complicated life but the simple life of primitive
            neighborhoods. Our task is very much more difficult. That sympathy
            which alone interprets public duty is more difficult for a public
            man to acquire now than it was then, because we live in the midst of
            circumstances and conditions infinitely complex.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">No man can boast that he understands
            <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place>. No man can boast that he has lived the life
            of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place>, as almost every man who sat in this hall
            in those days could boast. No man can pretend that except by common
            counsel he can gather into his consciousness what the varied life of
            this people is. The duty that we have to keep open eyes and open
            hearts and accessible understandings is a very much more difficult
            duty to perform than it was in their day. Yet how much more
            important that it should be performed, for fear we make infinite and
            irreparable blunders. The city of <place reg="Washington, DC" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Washington</place> is in some respects self-contained, and it is
            easy there to forget what the rest of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United
            States</place> is thinking about. I count it a fortunate
            circumstance that almost all the windows of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">White
            House</place> and its offices open upon unoccupied spaces that
            stretch to the banks of the Potomac and then out into
               <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Virginia</place> and on to the heavens themselves, and
            that as I sit there I can constantly forget <place reg="Washington, DC" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Washington</place> and remember the
               <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place>. Not that I would intimate that all
            of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> lies south of <place reg="Washington, DC" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Washington</place>, but there is a serious
            thing back of my thought. If you think too much about being
            reelected, it is very difficult to be worth reelecting. You are so
            apt to forget that the comparatively small number of persons,
            numerous as they seem to be when they swarm, who come to <place reg="Washington, DC" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Washington</place> to ask for things, do not
            constitute an important proportion of the population of the country,
            that it is constantly necessary to come away from <place reg="Washington, DC" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Washington</place> and renew one’s contact
            with the people who do not swarm there, who do not ask for anything,
            but who do trust you without their personal counsel to do your duty.
            Unless a man gets these contacts he grows weaker and weaker. He
            needs them as <person link-pointer-type="person">Hercules</person> needed the touch of mother
            earth. If you lift him up too high or he lifts himself too high, he
            loses the contact and therefore loses the inspiration.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I love to think of those plain men, however far from
            plain their dress sometimes was, who assembled in this hall. One is
            startled to think of the variety of costume and color which would
            now occur if we were let loose upon the fashions of that age. Men’s
            lack of taste is largely concealed now by the limitations of
            fashion. Yet these men, who sometimes dressed like the peacock,
            were, nevertheless, of the ordinary flight of their time. They were
            birds of a feather; they were birds come from a very simple
            breeding; they were much in the open heaven. They were beginning,
            when there was so little to distract their attention, to show that
            they could live upon fundamental principles of government. We talk
            those principles, but we have not time to absorb them. We have not
            time to let them into our blood, and thence have them translated
            into the plain mandates of action.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The very smallness of this room, the very simplicity
            of it all, all the suggestions which come from its restoration, are
            reassuring things—things which it becomes a man to realize.
            Therefore my theme here to-day, my only thought, is a very simple
            one. Do not let us go back to the annals of those sessions of
            Congress to find out what to do, because we live in another age and
            the circumstances are absolutely different; but let us be men of
            that kind; let us feel at every turn the compulsions of principle
            and of honor which thy felt; let us free our vision from temporary
            circumstances and look abroad at the horizon and take into our lungs
            the great air of freedom which has blown through this country and
            stolen across the seas and blessed people everywhere; and, looking
            east and west and north and south, let us remind ourselves that we
            are the custodians, in some degree, of the principles which have
            made men free and governments just.</p>

         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve"><render as="smallcap" rend="inherit">Your Excellency, Mr. Clothier,
               Mr. President</render>: That greeting sounds very familiar, and I
            am reminded of an anecdote told of that good artist, but better wit,
               <person link-pointer-type="person">Oliver Herford</person>. On one occasion, being seated at
            his club at lunch, a man whose manners he did not very much relish
            came up to him and slapped him on the back and said, “Hello, Ollie,
            old boy, how are you?” He looked up at the man somewhat coldly, and
            said, “I don’t know your name and I don’t know your face, but your
            manners are very familiar.” The manners exemplified in that cheer
            are delightfully familiar.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I find myself unaffectedly embarrassed to-day. I want
            to say, in sincere compliment, that I do not like to attempt an
            extemporaneous address following so finished an orator as the one
            who has just taken his seat. Moreover, I am somewhat confused as to
            my identity. I am told by psychologists that I would not know who I
            am to-day if I did not remember who I was yesterday; but when I
            recollect that yesterday I was a college president, that does not
            assist me in establishing my identity to-day. On the contrary, this
            very presence, the character of this audience, this place with its
            academic memories, all combine to remind me that the greater part of
            my active life has been spent in companies like this, and it will be
            difficult for me in what follows of this address to keep out of the
            old ruts of admonition which I have been accustomed to follow in the
            rôle of college president.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">No one can stand in the presence of a gathering like
            this, on a day suggesting the memories which this day suggests,
            without asking himself what a college is for. There have been times
            when I have suspected that certain undergraduates did not know. I
            remember that in days of discouragement as a teacher I gratefully
            recalled the sympathy of a friend of mine in the <place reg="Yale University" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Yale</place> faculty, who said that after
            20 years of teaching he had come to the conclusion that the human
            mind had infinite resources for resisting the introduction of
            knowledge. Yet I have my serious doubts as to whether the main
            object of a college is the introduction of knowledge. It may be the
            transmission of knowledge through the human system, but not much of
            it sticks. Its introduction is temporary; it is for the discipline
            of the hour. Most of what a man learns in college he assiduously
            forgets afterwards. Not because he purposes to forget it, but
            because the crowding events of the days that follow seem somehow to
            eliminate it.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">What a man ought never to forget with regard to a
            college is that it is a nursery of principle and of honor. I can not
            help thinking of <person link-pointer-type="person">William Penn</person> as a sort of
            spiritual knight who went out upon his adventures to carry the torch
            that had been put in his hands, so that other men might have the
            path illuminated for them which led to justice and to liberty. I can
            not admit that a man establishes his right to call himself a college
            graduate by showing me his diploma. The only way he can prove it is
            by showing that his eyes are lifted to some horizon which other men
            less instructed than he have not been privileged to see. Unless he
            carries freight of the spirit he has not been bred where spirits are
            bred.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">This man <person reg="William Penn" link-pointer-type="person">Penn</person>,
            representing the sweet enterprise of the quiet and powerful sect
            that called themselves <word altform="Quakers">Friends</word>,
            proved his right to the title by being the friend of mankind. He
            crossed <word altform="Atlantic Ocean">the ocean</word>, not merely
            to establish estates in <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place>, but to set up a free
            commonwealth in <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> and to show that he was of
            the lineage of those who had been bred in the best traditions of the
            human spirit. I would not be interested in celebrating the memory of
               <person link-pointer-type="person">William Penn</person> if his conquest had been merely a
            material one. Sometimes we have been laughed at—by foreigners in
            particular—for boasting of the size of the American Continent, the
            size of our own domain as a nation; for they have, naturally enough,
            suggested that we did not make it. But I claim that every race and
            every man is as big as the thing that he takes possession of, and
            that the size of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> is in some sense a standard
            of the size and capacity of the American people. And yet the mere
            extent of the American conquest is not what gives
            <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> distinction in the annals of the world, but
            the professed purpose of the conquest which was to see to it that
            every foot of this land should be the home of free, self-governed
            people, who should have no government whatever which did not rest
            upon the consent of the governed. I would like to believe that all
            this hemisphere is devoted to the same sacred purpose and that
            nowhere can any government endure which is stained by blood or
            supported by anything but the consent of the governed.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The spirit of <person reg="William Penn" link-pointer-type="person">Penn</person>
            will not be stayed. You can not set limits to such knightly
            adventurers. After their own day is gone their spirits stalk the
            world, carrying inspiration everywhere that they go and reminding
            men of the lineage, the fine lineage, of those who have sought
            justice and right. It is no small matter, therefore, for a college
            to have as its patron saint a man who went out upon such a conquest.
            What I would like to ask you young people to-day is: How many of you
            have devoted yourselves to the like adventure? How many of you will
            volunteer to carry these spiritual messages of liberty to the world?
            How many of you will forego anything except your allegiance to that
            which is just and that which is right? We die but once, and we die
            without distinction if we are not willing to die the death of
            sacrifice. Do you covet honor? You will never get it by serving
            yourself. Do you covet distinction? You will get it only as the
            servant of mankind. Do not forget, then, as you walk these classic
            places, why you are here. You are not here merely to prepare to make
            a living. You are here in order to enable the world to live more
            amply, with greater vision, with a finer spirit of hope and
            achievement. You are here to enrich the world, and you impoverish
            yourself if you forget the errand.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">It seems to me that there is no great difference
            between the ideals of the college and the ideals of the State. Can
            you not translate the one into the other? Men have not had to come
            to college, let me remind you, to quaff the fountains of this
            inspiration. You are merely more privileged than they. Men out of
            every walk of life, men without advantages of any kind, have seen
            the vision, and you, with it written large upon every page of your
            studies, are the more blind if you do not see it when it is pointed
            out. You could not be forgiven for overlooking it. They might have
            been. But they did not await instruction. They simply drew the
            breath of life into their lungs, felt the aspirations that must come
            to every human soul, looked out upon their brothers, and felt their
            pulses beat as their fellows’ beat, and then sought by counsel and
            action to move forward to common ends that would be crowned with
            honor and achievement. This is the only glory of
            <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place>. Let every generation of <place reg="Swarthmore College" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Swarthmore</place> men and women add to
            the strength of that lineage and the glory of that crown of
         life!</p>

         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve"><render as="smallcap" rend="inherit">Your Excellency, Mr.
            Chairman</render>: It is with unaffected pleasure that I find myself
            here to-day. I once before had the pleasure, in another southern
            city, of addressing the Southern Commercial Congress. I then spoke
            of what the future seemed to hold in store for this region, which so
            many of us love and toward the future of which we all look forward
            with so much confidence and hope. But another theme directed me here
            this time. I do not need to speak of the South. She has, perhaps,
            acquired the gift of speaking for herself. I come because I want to
            speak of our present and prospective relations with our neighbors to
            the south. I deemed it a public duty, as well as a personal
            pleasure, to be here to express for myself and for the Government I
            represent the welcome we all feel to those who represent the Latin
            American States.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The future, ladies and gentlemen, is going to be very
            different for this hemisphere from the past. These States lying to
            the south of us, which have always been our neighbors, will now be
            drawn closer to us by innumerable ties, and, I hope, chief of all,
            by the tie of a common understanding of each other. Interest does
            not tie nations together; it sometimes separates them. But sympathy
            and understanding does unite them, and I believe that by the new
            route that is just about to be opened, while we physically cut two
            continents asunder, we spiritually unite them. It is a spiritual
            union which we seek.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I wonder if you realize, I wonder if your imaginations
            have been filled with the significance of the tides of commerce.
            Your governor alluded in very fit and striking terms to the voyage
            of <person link-pointer-type="person">Columbus</person>, but <person link-pointer-type="person">Columbus</person> took his
            voyage under compulsion of circumstances.
            <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Constantinople</place> had been captured by the Turks and all
            the routes of trade with the East had been suddenly closed. If there
            was not a way across the Atlantic to open those routes again, they
            were closed forever, and <person link-pointer-type="person">Columbus</person> set out not to
            discover <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place>, for he did not know that it
            existed, but to discover the eastern shores of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Asia</place>.
            He set sail for <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Cathay</place> and stumbled upon
               <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place>. With that change in the outlook of the
            world, what happened? <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">England</place>, that had been at the
            back of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Europe</place> with an unknown sea behind her, found
            that all things had turned as if upon a pivot and she was at the
            front of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Europe</place>; and since then all the tides of
            energy and enterprise that have issued out of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Europe</place>
            have seemed to be turned westward across the Atlantic. But you will
            notice that they have turned westward chiefly north of the Equator
            and that it is the northern half of the globe that has seemed to be
            filled with the media of intercourse and of sympathy and of common
            understanding.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Do you not see now what is about to happen? These
            great tides which have been running along parallels of latitude will
            now swing southward athwart parallels of latitude, and that <word altform="Panama Canal">opening gate at the Isthmus of
            Panama</word> will open the world to a commerce that she has not
            known before, a commerce of intelligence, of thought and sympathy
            between North and South. The Latin American States, which, to their
            disadvantage, have been off the main lines, will now be on the main
            lines. I feel that these gentlemen honoring us with their presence
            to-day will presently find that some part, at any rate, of the
            center of gravity of the world has shifted. Do you realize that
               <place reg="New York, NY" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">New York</place>, for example, will be
            nearer the western coast of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">South America</place> than she is
            now to the eastern coast of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">South America</place>? Do you
            realize that a line drawn northward parallel with the greater part
            of the western coast of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">South America</place> will run only
            about 150 miles west of <place reg="New York, NY" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">New York</place>?
            The great bulk of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">South America</place>, if you will look at
            your globes (not at your Mercator’s projection), lies eastward of
            the continent of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">North America</place>. You will realize that
            when you realize that the canal will run southeast, not southwest,
            and that when you get into the Pacific you will be farther east than
            you were when you left the Gulf of Mexico. These things are
            significant, therefore, of this, that we are closing one chapter in
            the history of the world and are opening another, of great,
            unimaginable significance.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">There is one peculiarity about the history of the
            Latin American States which I am sure they are keenly aware of. You
            hear of “concessions” to foreign capitalists in <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Latin
            America</place>. You do not hear of concessions to foreign
            capitalists in the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place>. They are not
            granted concessions. They are invited to make investments. The work
            is ours, though they are welcome to invest in it. We do not ask them
            to supply the capital and do the work. It is an invitation, not a
            privilege; and States that are obliged, because their territory does
            not lie within the main field of modern enterprise and action, to
            grant concessions are in this condition, that foreign interests are
            apt to dominate their domestic affairs, a condition of affairs
            always dangerous and apt to become intolerable. What these States
            are going to see, therefore, is an emancipation from the
            subordination, which has been inevitable, to foreign enterprise and
            an assertion of the splendid character which, in spite of these
            difficulties, they have again and again been able to demonstrate.
            The dignity, the courage, the self-possession, the self-respect of
            the Latin American States, their achievements in the face of all
            these adverse circumstances, deserve nothing but the admiration and
            applause of the world. They have had harder bargains driven with
            them in the matter of loans than any other peoples in the world.
            Interest has been exacted of them that was not exacted of anybody
            else, because the risk was said to be greater; and then securities
            were taken that destroyed the risk—an admirable arrangement for
            those who were forcing the terms! I rejoice in nothing so much as in
            the prospect that they will now be emancipated from these
            conditions, and we ought to be the first to take part in assisting
            in that emancipation. I think some of these gentlemen have already
            had occasion to bear witness that the Department of State in recent
            months has tried to serve them in that wise. In the future they will
            draw closer and closer to us because of circumstances of which I
            wish to speak with moderation and, I hope, without indiscretion.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">We must prove ourselves their friends and champions
            upon terms of equality and honor. You can not be friends upon any
            other terms than upon the terms of equality. You can not be friends
            at all except upon the terms of honor. We must show ourselves
            friends by comprehending their interest whether it squares with our
            own interest or not. It is a very perilous thing to determine the
            foreign policy of a nation in the terms of material interest. It not
            only is unfair to those with whom you are dealing, but it is
            degrading as regards your own actions.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Comprehension must be the soil in which shall grow all
            the fruits of friendship, and there is a reason and a compulsion
            lying behind all this which is dearer than anything else to the
            thoughtful men of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place>. I mean the development of
            constitutional liberty in the world. Human rights, national
            integrity, and opportunity as against material interests—that,
            ladies and gentlemen, is the issue which we now have to face. I want
            to take this occasion to say that the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place>
            will never again seek one additional foot of territory by conquest.
            She will devote herself to showing that she knows how to make
            honorable and fruitful use of the territory she has, and she must
            regard it as one of the duties of friendship to see that from no
            quarter are material interests made superior to human liberty and
            national opportunity. I say this, not with a single thought that
            anyone will gainsay it, but merely to fix in our consciousness what
            our real relationship with the rest of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> is. It
            is the relationship of a family of mankind devoted to the
            development of true constitutional liberty. We know that that is the
            soil out of which the best enterprise springs. We know that this is
            a cause which we are making in common with our neighbors, because we
            have had to make it for ourselves.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Reference has been made here to-day to some of the
            national problems which confront us as a nation. What is at the
            heart of all our national problems? It is that we have seen the hand
            of material interest sometimes about to close upon our dearest
            rights and possessions. We have seen material interests threaten
            constitutional freedom in the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place>.
            Therefore we will now know how to sympathize with those in the rest
            of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> who have to contend with such powers, not
            only within their borders but from outside their borders also.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I know what the response of the thought and heart of
               <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> will be to the program I have outlined,
            because <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> was created to realize a program like
            that. This is not <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> because it is rich. This is
            not <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> because it has set up for a great
            population great opportunities of material prosperity.
               <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> is a name which sounds in the ears of men
            everywhere as a synonym with individual opportunity because a
            synonym of individual liberty. I would rather belong to a poor
            nation that was free than to a rich nation that had ceased to be in
            love with liberty. But we shall not be poor if we love liberty,
            because the nation that loves liberty truly sets every man free to
            do his best and be his best, and that means the release of all the
            splendid energies of a great people who think for themselves. A
            nation of employees can not be free any more than a nation of
            employers can be.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">In emphasizing the points which must unite us in
            sympathy and in spiritual interest with the Latin American peoples
            we are only emphasizing the points of our own life, and we should
            prove ourselves untrue to our own traditions if we proved ourselves
            untrue friends to them. Do not think, therefore, gentlemen, that the
            questions of the day are mere questions of policy and diplomacy.
            They are shot through with the principles of life. We dare not turn
            from the principle that morality and not expediency is the thing
            that must guide us and that we will never condone iniquity because
            it is most convenient to do so. It seems to me that this is a day of
            infinite hope, of confidence in a future greater than the past has
            been, for I am fain to believe that in spite of all the things that
            we wish to correct the nineteenth century that now lies behind us
            has brought us a long stage toward the time when, slowly ascending
            the tedious climb that leads to the final uplands, we shall get our
            ultimate view of the duties of mankind. We have breasted a
            considerable part of that climb and shall presently—it may be in a
            generation or two—come out upon those great heights where there
            shines unobstructed the light of the justice of God.</p>

            <render as="italic" rend="inherit">Mr. Speaker, Mr. President, Gentlemen of the
               Congress:</render>
         </p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">In pursuance of my constitutional duty to “give to the
            Congress information of the state of the Union,” I take the liberty
            of addressing you on several matters which ought, as it seems to me,
            particularly to engage the attention of your honorable bodies, as of
            all who study the welfare and progress of the Nation.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I shall ask your indulgence if I venture to depart in
            some degree from the usual custom of setting before you in formal
            review the many matters which have engaged the attention and called
            for the action of the several departments of the Government or which
            look to them for early treatment in the future, because the list is
            long, very long, and would suffer in the abbreviation to which I
            should have to subject it. I shall submit to you the reports of the
            heads of the several departments, in which these subjects are set
            forth in careful detail, and beg that they may receive the
            thoughtful attention of your committees and of all Members of the
            Congress who may have the leisure to study them. Their obvious
            importance, as constituting the very substance of the business of
            the Government, makes comment and emphasis on my part unnecessary.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The country, I am thankful to say, is at peace with
            all the world, and many happy manifestations multiply about us of a
            growing cordiality and sense of community of interest among the
            nations, foreshadowing an age of settled peace and good will. More
            and more readily each decade do the nations manifest their
            willingness to bind themselves by solemn treaty to the processes of
            peace, the processes of frankness and fair concession. So far the
               <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> has stood at the front of such
            negotiations. She will, I earnestly hope and confidently believe,
            give fresh proof of her sincere adherence to the cause of
            international friendship by ratifying the several treaties of
            arbitration awaiting renewal by the Senate. In addition to these, it
            has been the privilege of the Department of State to gain the
            assent, in principle, of no less than 31 nations, representing
            four-fifths of the population of the world, to the negotiation of
            treaties by which it shall be agreed that whenever differences of
            interest or of policy arise which can not be resolved by the
            ordinary processes of diplomacy they shall be publicly analyzed,
            discussed, and reported upon by a tribunal chosen by the parties
            before either nation determines its course of action.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">There is only one possible standard by which to
            determine controversies between the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> and
            other nations, and that is compounded of these two elements: Our own
            honor and our obligations to the peace of the world. A test so
            compounded ought easily to be made to govern both the establishment
            of new treaty obligations and the interpretation of those already
            assumed.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">There is but one cloud upon our horizon. That has
            shown itself to the south of us, and hangs over
            <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Mexico</place>. There can be no certain prospect of peace in
               <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> until <person refurl="x4002421" reg="Victoriano Huerta" link-pointer-type="person">Gen.
            Huerta</person> has surrendered his usurped authority in
               <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Mexico</place>; until it is understood on all hands,
            indeed, that such pretended governments will not be countenanced or
            dealt with by the Government of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place>. We
            are the friends of constitutional government in
            <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place>; we are more than its friends, we are its
            champions; because in no other way can our neighbors, to whom we
            would wish in every way to make proof of our friendship, work out
            their own development in peace and liberty. <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Mexico</place>
            has no Government. The attempt to maintain one at the <place reg="Mexico City, Mexico" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">City of Mexico</place> has broken down,
            and a mere military despotism has been set up which has hardly more
            than the semblance of national authority. It originated in the
            usurpation of <person refurl="x4002421" reg="Victoriano Huerta" link-pointer-type="person">Victoriano Huerta</person>, who, after
            a brief attempt to play the part of constitutional President, has at
            last cast aside even the pretense of legal right and declared
            himself dictator. As a consequence, a condition of affairs now
            exists in <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Mexico</place> which has made it doubtful whether
            even the most elementary and fundamental rights either of her own
            people or of the citizens of other countries resident within her
            territory can long be successfully safeguarded, and which threatens,
            if long continued, to imperil the interests of peace, order, and
            tolerable life in the lands immediately to the south of us. Even if
            the usurper had succeeded in his purposes, in despite of the
            constitution of the <placeRef reg="Mexico" link-pointer-type="place">Republic</placeRef> and
            the rights of its people, he would have set up nothing but a
            precarious and hateful power, which could have lasted but a little
            while, and whose eventual downfall would have left the country in a
            more deplorable condition than ever. But he has not succeeded. He
            has forfeited the respect and the moral support even of those who
            were at one time willing to see him succeed. Little by little he has
            been completely isolated. By a little every day his power and
            prestige are crumbling and the collapse is not far away. We shall
            not, I believe, be obliged to alter our policy of watchful waiting.
            And then, when the end comes, we shall hope to see constitutional
            order restored in distressed <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Mexico</place> by the concert
            and energy of such of her leaders as prefer the liberty of their
            people to their own ambitions.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I turn to matters of domestic concern. You already
            have under consideration a bill for the reform of our system of
            banking and currency, for which the country waits with impatience,
            as for something fundamental to its whole business life and
            necessary to set credit free from arbitrary and artificial
            restraints. I need not say how earnestly I hope for its early
            enactment into law. I take leave to beg that the whole energy and
            attention of the Senate be concentrated upon it till the matter is
            successfully disposed of. And yet I feel that the request is not
            needed—that the Members of that great House need no urging in this
            service to the country.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I present to you, in addition, the urgent necessity
            that special provision be made also for facilitating the credits
            needed by the farmers of the country. The pending currency bill does
            the farmers a great service. It puts them upon an equal footing with
            other business men and masters of enterprise, as it should; and upon
            its passage they will find themselves quit of many of the
            difficulties which now hamper them in the field of credit. The
            farmers, of course, ask and should be given no special privilege,
            such as extending to them the credit of the Government itself. What
            they need and should obtain is legislation which will make their own
            abundant and substantial credit resources available as a foundation
            for joint, concerted local action in their own behalf in getting the
            capital they must use. It is to this we should now address
            ourselves.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">It has, singularly enough, come to pass that we have
            allowed the industry of our farms to lag behind the other activities
            of the country in its development. I need not stop to tell you how
            fundamental to the life of the Nation is the production of its food.
            Our thoughts may ordinarily be concentrated upon the cities and the
            hives of industry, upon the cries of the crowded market place and
            the clangor of the factory, but it is from the quiet interspaces of
            the open valleys and the free hillsides that we draw the sources of
            life and of prosperity, from the farm and the ranch, from the forest
            and the mine. Without these every street would be silent, every
            office deserted, every factory fallen into disrepair. And yet the
            farmer does not stand upon the same footing with the forester and
            the miner in the market of credit. He is the servant of the seasons.
            Nature determines how long he must wait for his crops, and will not
            be hurried in her processes. He may give his note, but the season of
            its maturity depends upon the season when his crop matures, lies at
            the gates of the market where his products are sold. And the
            security he gives is of a character not known in the broker’s office
            or as familiarly as it might be on the counter of the banker.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The Agricultural Department of the Government is
            seeking to assist as never before to make farming an efficient
            business, of wide cooperative effort, in quick touch with the
            markets for foodstuffs. The farmers and the Government will
            henceforth work together as real partners in this field, where we
            now begin to see our way very clearly and where many intelligent
            plans are already being put into execution. The Treasury of the
               <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> has, by a timely and well-considered
            distribution of its deposits, facilitated the moving of the crops in
            the present season and prevented the scarcity of available funds too
            often experienced at such times. But we must not allow ourselves to
            depend upon extraordinary expedients. We must add the means by which
            the farmer may make his credit constantly and easily available and
            command when he will the capital by which to support and expand his
            business. We lag behind many other great countries of the modern
            world in attempting to do this. Systems of rural credit have been
            studied and developed on the other side of the water while we left
            our farmers to shift for themselves in the ordinary money market.
            You have but to look about you in any rural district to see the
            result, the handicap and embarrassment which have been put upon
            those who produce our food.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Conscious of this backwardness and neglect on our
            part, the Congress recently authorized the creation of a special
            commission to study the various systems of rural credit which have
            been put into operation in <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Europe</place>, and this
            commission is already prepared to report. Its report ought to make
            it easier for us to determine what methods will be best suited to
            our own farmers. I hope and believe that the committees of the
            Senate and House will address themselves to this matter with the
            most fruitful results, and I believe that the studies and recently
            formed plans of the Department of Agriculture may be made to serve
            them very greatly in their work of framing appropriate and adequate
            legislation. It would be indiscreet and presumptuous in anyone to
            dogmatize upon so great and many-sided a question, but I feel
            confident that common counsel will produce the results we must all
            desire.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Turn from the farm to the world of business which
            centers in the city and in the factory, and I think that all
            thoughtful observers will agree that the immediate service we owe
            the business communities of the country is to prevent private
            monopoly more effectually than it has yet been prevented. I think it
            will be easily agreed that we should let the Sherman antitrust law
            stand, unaltered, as it is, with its debatable ground about it, but
            that we should as much as possible reduce the area of that debatable
            ground by further and more explicit legislation; and should also
            supplement that great act by legislation which will not only clarify
            it but also facilitate its adminstration and make it fairer to all
            concerned. No doubt we shall all wish, and the country will expect,
            this to be the central subject of our deliberations during the
            present session; but it is a subject so many-sided and so deserving
            of careful and discriminating discussion that I shall take the
            liberty of addressing you upon it in a special message at a later
            date than this. It is of capital importance that the business men of
            this country should be relieved of all uncertainties of law with
            regard to their enterprises and investments and a clear path
            indicated which they can travel without anxiety. It is as important
            that they should be relieved of embarrassment and set free to
            prosper as that private monopoly should be destroyed. The ways of
            action should be thrown wide open.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I turn to a subject which I hope can be handled
            promptly and without serious controversy of any kind. I mean the
            method of selecting nominees for the Presidency of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United
               States</place>. I feel confident that I do not misinterpret the
            wishes or the expectations of the country when I urge the prompt
            enactment of legislation which will provide for primary elections
            throughout the country at which the voters of the several parties
            may choose their nominees for the Presidency without the
            intervention of nominating conventions. I venture the suggestion
            that this legislation should provide for the retention of party
            conventions, but only for the purpose of declaring and accepting the
            verdict of the primaries and formulating the platforms of the
            parties; and I suggest that these conventions should consist not of
            delegates chosen for this single purpose, but of the nominees for
            Congress, the nominees for vacant seats in the Senate of the
               <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place>, the Senators whose terms have not
            yet closed, the national committees, and the candidates for the
            Presidency themselves, in order that platforms may be framed by
            those responsible to the people for carrying them into effect.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">These are all matters of vital domestic concern, and
            besides them, outside the charmed circle of our own national life in
            which our affections command us, as well as our consciences, there
            stand out our obligations toward our territories over sea. Here we
            are trustees. <place reg="Puerto Rico" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Porto Rico</place>,
               <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Hawaii</place>, the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Philippines</place>, are ours,
            indeed, but not ours to do what we please with. Such territories,
            once regarded as mere possessions, are no longer to be selfishly
            exploited; they are part of the domain of public conscience and of
            serviceable and enlightened statesmanship. We must administer them
            for the people who live in them and with the same sense of
            responsibility to them as toward our own people in our domestic
            affairs. No doubt we shall successfully enough bind <place reg="Puerto Rico" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Porto Rico</place> and the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Hawaiian
               Islands</place> to ourselves by ties of justice and interest and
            affection, but the performance of our duty toward the
               <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Philippines</place> is a more difficult and debatable
            matter. We can satisfy the obligations of generous justice toward
            the people of <place reg="Puerto Rico" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Porto Rico</place> by giving
            them the ample and familiar rights and privileges accorded our own
            citizens in our own territories and our obligations toward the
            people of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Hawaii</place> by perfecting the provisions for
            self-government already granted them, but in the
            <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Philippines</place> we must go further. We must hold steadily
            in view their ultimate independence, and we must move toward the
            time of that independence as steadily as the way can be cleared and
            the foundations thoughtfully and permanently laid.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Acting under the authority conferred upon the
            President by Congress, I have already accorded the people of the
            islands a majority in both houses of their legislative body by
            appointing five instead of four native citizens to the membership of
            the commission. I believe that in this way we shall make proof of
            their capacity in counsel and their sense of responsibility in the
            exercise of political power, and that the success of this step will
            be sure to clear our view for the steps which are to follow. Step by
            step we should extend and perfect the system of self government in
            the islands, making test of them and modifying them as experience
            discloses their successes and their failures; that we should more
            and more put under the control of the native citizens of the
            archipelago the essential instruments of their life, their local
            instrumentalities of government, their schools, all the common
            interests of their communities, and so by counsel and experience set
            up a government which all the world will see to be suitable to a
            people whose affairs are under their own control. At last, I hope
            and believe, we are beginning to gain the confidence of the Filipino
            peoples. By their counsel and experience, rather than by our own, we
            shall learn how best to serve them and how soon it will be possible
            and wise to withdraw our supervision. Let us once find the path and
            set out with firm and confident tread upon it and we shall not
            wander from it or linger upon it.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">A duty faces us with regard to <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Alaska</place>
            which seems to me very pressing and very imperative; perhaps I
            should say a double duty, for it concerns both the political and the
            material development of the Territory. The people of
            <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Alaska</place> should be given the full Territorial form of
            government, and <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Alaska</place>, as a storehouse, should be
            unlocked. One key to it is a system of railways. These the
            Government should itself build and administer, and the ports and
            terminals it should itself control in the interest of all who wish
            to use them for the service and development of the country and its
            people.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">But the construction of railways is only the first
            step; is only thrusting in the key to the storehouse and throwing
            back the lock and opening the door. How the tempting resources of
            the country are to be exploited is another matter, to which I shall
            take the liberty of from time to time calling your attention, for it
            is a policy which must be worked out by well-considered stages, not
            upon theory, but upon lines of practical expediency. It is part of
            our general problem of conservation. We have a freer hand in working
            out the problem in <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Alaska</place> than in the States of the
            Union; and yet the principle and object are the same, wherever we
            touch it. We must use the resources of the country, not lock them
            up. There need be no conflict or jealousy as between State and
            Federal authorities, for there can be no essential difference of
            purpose between them. The resources in question must be used, but
            not destroyed or wasted; used, but not monopolized upon any narrow
            idea of individual rights as against the abiding interests of
            communities. That a policy can be worked out by conference and
            concession which will release these resources and yet not jeopard or
            dissipate them, I for one have no doubt; and it can be done on lines
            of regulation which need be no less acceptable to the people and
            governments of the States concerned than to the people and
            Government of the Nation at large, whose heritage these resources
            are. We must bend our counsels to this end. A common purpose ought
            to make agreement easy.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Three or four matters of special importance and
            significance I beg that you will permit me to mention in closing.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Our Bureau of Mines ought to be equipped and empowered
            to render even more effectual service than it renders now in
            improving the conditions of mine labor and making the mines more
            economically productive as well as more safe. This is an
            all-important part of the work of conservation; and the conservation
            of human life and energy lies even nearer to our interest than the
            preservation from waste of our material resources.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">We owe it, in mere justice to the railway employees of
            the country, to provide for them a fair and effective employers’
            liability act; and a law that we can stand by in this matter will be
            no less to the advantage of those who administer the railroads of
            the country than to the advantage of those whom they employ. The
            experience of a large number of the States abundantly proves that.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">We ought to devote ourselves to meeting pressing
            demands of plain justice like this as earnestly as to the
            accomplishment of political and economic reforms. Social justice
            comes first. Law is the machinery for its realization and is vital
            only as it expresses and embodies it.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">An international congress for the discussion of all
            questions that affect safety at sea is now sitting in <place reg="London, England" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">London</place> at the suggestion of our own
            Government. So soon as the conclusions of that congress can be
            learned and considered we ought to address ourselves, among other
            things, to the prompt alleviation of the very unsafe, unjust, and
            burdensome conditions which now surround the employment of sailors
            and render it extremely difficult to obtain the services of spirited
            and competent men such as every ship needs if it is to be safely
            handled and brought to port.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">May I not express the very real pleasure I have
            experienced in cooperating with this Congress and sharing with it
            the labors of common service to which it has devoted itself so
            unreservedly during the past seven months of uncomplaining
            concentration upon the business of legislation? Surely it is a
            proper and pertinent part of my report on “the state of the Union”
            to express my admiration for the diligence, the good temper, and the
            full comprehension of public duty which has already been manifested
            by both the Houses; and I hope that it may not be deemed an
            impertinent intrusion of myself into the picture if I say with how
            much and how constant satisfaction I have availed myself of the
            privilege of putting my time and energy at their disposal alike in
            counsel and in action.</p>

         <p rend="noindent" xml:space="preserve"><render rend="inherit" as="italic">Gentlemen of the <name reg="US Congress" type="org">Congress</name>:</render></p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">In pursuance of my constitutional duty to “give to the <name reg="US Congress" type="org">Congress</name> information of the state of the Union,” I take the liberty of addressing you on several matters which ought, as it seems to me, particularly to engage the attention of your honorable bodies, as of all who study the welfare and progress of the Nation.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I shall ask your indulgence if I venture to depart in some degree from the usual custom of setting before you in formal review the many matters which have engaged the attention and called for the action of the several departments of the Government or which look to them for early treatment in the future, because the list is long, very long, and would suffer in the abbreviation to which I should have to subject it. I shall submit to you the reports of the heads of the several departments, in which these subjects are set forth in careful detail, and beg that they may receive the thoughtful attention  of your committees and of all Members of the <name reg="US Congress" type="org">Congress</name> who may have the leisure to study them. Their obvious importance, as constituting the very substance of the business of the Government, makes comment and emphasis on my part unnecessary.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The country, I am thankful to say, is at peace with all the world, and many happy manifestations multiply about us of a growing cordiality and sense of community of interest among the nations, foreshadowing an age of settled peace and good will. More and more readily each decade do the nations manifest their willingness to bind themselves by solemn treaty to the processes of peace, the processes of frankness and fair concession. So far the <place reg="The United States of America" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> has stood at the front of such negotiations. She will, I earnestly hope and confidently believe, give fresh proof of her sincere adherence to the cause of international friendship by ratifying the several treaties of arbitration awaiting renewal by the <name reg="US Senate" type="org">Senate</name>. In addition to these, it has been the privilege of the <name reg="US State Department" type="org">Department of State</name> to gain the assent, in principle, of no less than 31 nations, representing four–fifths of the population of the world, to the negotiation of treaties by which it shall be agreed that whenever differences of interest or of policy arise which can not be resolved by the ordinary processes of diplomacy they shall be publically analyzed, discussed, and reported upon by a tribunal chosen by the parties before either nation determines its course of action.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">There is only one possible standard by which to determine controversies between the <place reg="The United States of America" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> and other nations, and that is compounded of these two elements: Our own honor and our obligations to the peace of the world. A test so compounded ought easily to be made to govern both the establishment of new treaty obligations and the interpretation of those already assumed.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">There is but one cloud upon our horizon. That has shown itself to the south of us, and hangs over Mexico. There can be no certain prospect of peace in America until <person refurl="x4002421" reg="Victoriano Huerta" link-pointer-type="person">Gen. Huerta</person> has surrendered his usurped authority in Mexico; until it is understood on all hands, indeed, that such pretended governments will not be countenanced or dealt with by the Government of the <place reg="The United States of America" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place>. We are the friends of constitutional government in America; we are more than its friends, we are its champions; because in no other way can our neighbors, to whom we would wish in every way to make proof  of our friendship, work out their own development in peace and liberty. Mexico has no Government. The attempt to maintain one at the <place reg="Mexico City, Mexico" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">City of Mexico</place> has broken down, and a mere military despotism has been set up which has hardly more than the semblance of national authority. It originated in the usurpation of <person refurl="x4002421" reg="Victoriano Huerta" link-pointer-type="person">Victoriano Huerta</person>, who, after a brief attempt to play the part of constitutional President, has at last cast aside even the pretense of legal right and declared himself dictator. As a consequence, a condition of affairs now exists in Mexico which has made it doubtful whether even the most elementary and fundamental rights either of her own people or of the citizens of other countries resident within her territory can long be successfully safeguarded, and which threatens, if long continued , to imperil the interests of peace, order, and tolerable life in the lands immediately to the south of us. Even if the usurper had succeeded in his purposes, in despite of the constitution of the Republic and the rights of its people, he would have set up nothing but a precarious and hateful power, which could have lasted but a little while, and whose eventual downfall would have left the country in a more deplorable condition than ever. But he has not succeeded. He has forfeited the respect and the moral support even of those who were at one time willing to see him succeed. Little by little be has been completely isolated. By a little every day his power and prestige are crumbling and the collapse is not far away. We shall not, I believe, be obliged to alter our policy of watchful waiting. And then, when the end comes, we shall hope to see constitutional order restored in distressed Mexico by the concert and energy of such of her leaders as prefer the liberty of their people to their own ambitions.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I turn to matters of domestic concern. You already have under consideration a bill for the reform of our system of banking and currency, for which the country waits with impatience, as for something fundamental to its whole business life and necessary to set credit free from arbitrary and artificial restraints. I need not say how earnestly I hope for its early enactment into law. I take leave to beg that the whole energy and attention of the <name reg="US Senate" type="org">Senate</name> be concentrated upon it till the matter is successfully disposed of. And yet, I feel that the request is not needed—that the Members of that great House need no urging in this service to the country.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I present to you, in addition, the urgent necessity that special provision be made also for facilitating the <render as="underscore" rend="inherit">credits needed by the farmers</render> of the country. The pending currency bill does the farmers a great service. It puts them upon an equal footing with other business men and masters of enterprise, as it should; and upon its passage they will find themselves quit of many of the difficulties which now hamper them in the field of credit. The farmers, of course, ask and should be given no special privilege, such as extending to them the credit of the Government itself. What they need and should obtain is legislation which will make their own abundant and substantial credit resources available as a foundation for joint, concerted local action in their own behalf in getting the capital they must use. It is to this we should now address ourselves.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">It has, singularly enough, come to pass that we have allowed the industry of our farms to lag behind the other activities of the country in its development. I need not stop to tell you how fundamental to the life of the Nation is the production of its food. Our thoughts may ordinarily be concentrated upon the cities and the hives of industry, upon the cries of the crowded market place and the clangor of the factory, but it is from the quiet interspaces of the open valleys and the free hillsides that we draw the sources of life and of prosperity, from the farm and the ranch, from the forest and the mine. Without these every street would be silent, every office deserted, every factory fallen into disrepair. And yet the farmer does not stand upon the same footing with the forester and the miner in the market of credit. He is the servant of the seasons. Nature determines how long he must wait for his crops, and will not be hurried in her processes. He may give his note, but the season of its maturity depends upon the season when his crop matures, lies at the gates of the market where his products are sold. And the security he gives is of a character not known in the broker’s office or as familiarly as it might be on the counter of the banker.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The <name reg="US Agriculture Department" type="person">Agricultural Department</name> of the Government is seeking to assist as never before to make farming an efficient business, of wide cooperative effort, in quick touch with the markets for foodstuffs. The farmers and the Government will henceforth work together as real partners in this field, where we now begin to see our way very clearly and where many intelligent plans are already being put into execution. The <name reg="US Treasury Department" type="org">Treasury of the United States</name> has, but a timely and well–considered distribution of its deposits, facilitated the moving of the crops in the present season and prevented the scarcity of available funds too often experienced at such times. But we must not allow ourselves to depend upon extraordinary expedients. We must add the means by which the farmer may make his credit constantly and easily available and command when he will the capital by which to support and expand his business. We lag behind many other great countries of the modern world in attempting to do this. Systems of rural credit have been studied and developed on the other side of the water while we left our farmers to shift for themselves in the ordinary  money market. You have but to look about you in any rural district to see the result, the handicap and embarrassment which have been put upon those who produce our food.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Conscious of this backwardness and neglect on our part, the Congress recently authorized the creation of a special commission to study the various systems of rural credit which have been put into operation in Europe, and this commission is already prepared to report. Its report ought to make it easier for us to determine what methods will be best suited to our own farmers. I hope and believe that the committees of the <name reg="US Senate" type="org">Senate</name> and <name reg="US House of Representatives" type="person">House</name> will address themselves to this matter with the most fruitful results, and I believe that the studies and recently formed plans of the <name reg="US Agriculture Department" type="person">Deparment of Agriculture</name> may be made to serve them very greatly in their work of framing appropriate and adequate legislation. It would be indiscreet and presumptuous in anyone to dogmatize upon so great and many–sided a question, but I feel confident that common counsel will produce the results we must all desire.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Turn from the farm to the world of business which centers in the city and in the factory, and I think that all thoughtful observers will agree that the immediate service we owe the business communities of  the country is to prevent private monopoly more effectually than it has yet been prevented. I think it will be easily agreed that we should let the Sherman antitrust law stand, unaltered, as it is, with its debatable ground about it, but that we should as much as possible reduce the area of that debatable ground by further and more explicit legislation; and should also supplement that great act by legislation which will not only clarify it but also facilitate its administration and make it fairer to all concerned. No doubt we shall all wish, and the country will expect, this to be the central subject of our deliberations during the present session; but it is  a subject so many–sided and so deserving of careful and discriminating discussion that I shall take the liberty of addressing you upon it in a special message at a later date than this. It is of capital importance that the business men of this country should be relieved of all uncertainties of law with regard to their enterprises and investments and a clear path indicated which they can travel without anxiety. It is as important that they should be relieved of embarrassment and set free to prosper as that private monopoly should be destroyed. The ways of action should be thrown wide open.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I turn to a subject which I hope can be handled promptly and without serious controversy of any kind. I mean the method of selecting nominees for the Presidency of the <place reg="The United States of America" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place>. I feel confident that I do not misinterpret the wishes or the expectations of the country when I urge the prompt enactment of legislation which will provide for primary elections throughout the country at which the voters of the several parties may choose their nominees for the Presidency without the intervention of nominating conventions. I venture the suggestion that this legislation should provide for the retention of party conventions, but only for the purpose of declaring and accepting the verdict of the primaries and formulating the platforms of the parties; and I suggest that these conventions should consist not of delegates chosen for this single purpose, but of the nominees for Congress, the nominees for vacant seats in the <name reg="US Senate" type="org">Senate</name> of the <place reg="The United States of America" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place>, the Senators whose terms have not yet closed, the national committees, and the candidates for the Presidency themselves, in order that platforms may be framed by those responsible to the people for carrying them into effect.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">These are all matters of vital domestic concern, and besides them, outside the charmed circle of our own national life in which our affections command us, as well as our consciences, there stand out our obligations toward our territories over sea. Here we are trustees. <place reg="Puerto Rico" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Porto Rico</place>, Hawaii, the Philippines, are ours, indeed, but not ours to do what we please with. Such territories, once regarded as mere possessions, are no longer to be selfishly exploited; they are part of the domain of public conscience and of serviceable and enlightened statesmanship. We must administer them for the people who live in them and with the same sense of responsibility to them as toward our own people in our domestic affairs. No doubt we shall successfully enough bind <place reg="Puerto Rico" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Porto Rico</place> and the Hawaiian Islands to ourselves by ties of justice and interest and affection, but the performance of our duty toward the Philippines is a more difficult and debatable matter. We can satisfy the obligations of generous justice toward the people of <place reg="Puerto Rico" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Porto Rico</place> by giving them the ample and familiar rights and privileges accorded our own citizens in our own territories and our obligations toward the people of Hawaii by perfecting the provisions for self–government already granted them, but in the Philippines we must go further. We must hold steadily in view their ultimate independence, and we must move toward the time of that independence as steadily as the way can be cleared and the foundations thoughtfully and permanently laid.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Acting under the authority conferred upon the President by Congress, I have already accorded the people of the islands a majority in both houses of their legislative body by appointing five instead of four native citizens to the membership of the commission. I believe that in this way we shall make proof of their capacity in counsel and their sense of responsibility in the exercise of political power, and that the success of this step will be sure to clear our view for the steps which are to follow. Step by step we should extend and perfect the system of self–government in the islands, making test of them and modifying them as experience discloses their successes and their failures; that we should more and more put under the control of the native citizens of the archipelago the essential instruments of their life, their local instrumentalities of government, their schools, all the common interests of their communities, and so by counsel and experience set up a government which all the world will see to be suitable to a people whose affairs are under their own control. At last, I hope and believe, we are beginning to gain the confidence of the Filipino peoples. By their counsel and experience, rather than by our own, we shall learn how best to serve them and how soon it will be possible and wise to withdraw our supervision. Let us once find the path and set out with firm and confident tread upon it and we shall not wander from it or linger upon it.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">A duty faces us with regard to Alaska which seems to me very pressing and very imperative; perhaps I should say a double duty, for it concerns both the political and the material development of the Territory. The people of Alaska should be given the full Territorial form of government, and Alaska, as a storehouse, should be unlocked. One key to it is a system of railways. These the Government should itself build and administer, and the ports and terminals it should itself control in the interest of all who wish to use them for the service and development of the country and its people.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">But the construction of railways is only the first step; is only thrusting in the key to the storehouse and throwing back the lock and opening the door. How the tempting resources of the country are to be exploited is another matter, to which I shall take the liberty of from time to time calling your attention, for it is a policy which must be worked out by well–considered stages, not upon theory, but upon lines of practical expediency. It is part of our general problem of conservation. We have a freer hand in working out the problem in Alaska than in the States of the Union; and yet the principle and object are the same, wherever we touch it. We must use the resources of the country, not lock them up. There need be no conflict or jealousy as between State and Federal authorities, for there can be no essential difference of purpose between them. The resources in question must be used, but not destroyed or wasted; used, but not monopolized upon any narrow idea of individual rights as against the abiding interests of communities. That a policy can be worked out by conference and concession which will release these resources and yet not jeopard or dissipate them, I for one have no doubt; and it can be done on lines of regulation which need be no less acceptable to the people and governments of the States concerned than to the people and Government of the Nation at large, whose heritage these resources are. We must bend our counsels to this end. A common purpose ought to make agreement easy.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Three or four matters of special importance and significance I beg that you will permit me to mention in closing.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Our Bureau of Mines ought to be equipped and empowered to render even more effectual service than it renders now in improving the conditions of mine labor and making the mines more economically productive as well as more safe. This is an all–important part of the work of conservation; and the conservation of human life and energy lies even nearer to our interest than the preservation from waste of our material resources.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">We owe it, in mere justice to the railway employees of the country, to provide for them a fair and effective employers’ liability act; and a law that we can stand by in this matter will be no less to the advantage of those who administer the railroads of the country than to the advantage of those whom they employ. The experience of a large number of the States abundantly proves that.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">We ought to devote ourselves to meeting pressing demands of plain justice like this as earnestly as to the accomplishment of political and economic reforms. Social justice comes first. Law is the machinery for its realization and is vital only as it expresses and embodies it.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">An international congress for the discussion of all questions that affect safety at sea is now sitting in <place reg="London, England" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">London</place> at the suggestion of our own Government. So soon as the conclusions of that congress can be learned and considered we ought to address ourselves, among other things, to the prompt alleviation of the very unsafe, unjust, and burdensome conditions which now surround the employment of sailors and render it extremely difficult to obtain the services of spirited and competent men such as every ship needs if it is to be safely handled and brought to port.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">May I not express the very real pleasure I have experienced in cooperating with this Congress and sharing with it the labors of common service to which it has devoted itself so unreservedly during the past seven months of uncomplaining concentration upon the business of legislation? Surely it is a proper and pertinent part of my report on “the state of the Union” to express my admiration for the diligence, the good temper, and the full comprehension of public duty which has already been manifested by both the Houses, and I hope that it may not be deemed an impertinent intrusion of myself into the picture if I say with how much and how constant satisfaction I have availed myself of the privilege of putting my time   and energy at their disposal alike in counsel and in action.</p>

         <p rend="noindent" xml:space="preserve"><render as="smallcap" rend="inherit">Gentlemen of the Congress</render>:</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">In pursuance of my constitutional duty to “give to the <name reg="US Congress" type="org">Congress</name> information of the state of the Union,” I take the liberty of addressing you on several matters which ought, as it seems to me, particularly to engage the attention of your honorable bodies, as of all who study the welfare and progress of the Nation.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I shall ask your indulgence if I venture to depart in some degree from the usual custom of setting before you in formal review the many matters which have engaged the attention and called for the action of the several departments of the Government or which look to them for early treatment in the future, because the list is long, very long, and would suffer in the abbreviation to which I should have to subject it. I shall submit to you the reports of the heads of the several departments, in which these subjects are set forth in careful detail, and beg that they may receive the thoughtful attention  of your committees and of all Members of the <name reg="US Congress" type="org">Congress</name> who may have the leisure to study them. Their obvious importance, as constituting the very substance of the business of the Government, makes comment and emphasis on my part unnecessary.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The country, I am thankful to say, is at peace with all the world, and many happy manifestations multiply about us of a growing cordiality and sense of community of interest among the nations, foreshadowing an age of settled peace and good will. More and more readily each decade do the nations manifest their willingness to bind themselves by solemn treaty to the processes of peace, the processes of frankness and fair concession. So far the <place reg="The United States of America" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> has stood at the front of such negotiations. She will, I earnestly hope and confidently believe, give fresh proof of her sincere adherence to the cause of international friendship by ratifying the several treaties of arbitration awaiting renewal by the <name reg="US Senate" type="org">Senate</name>. In addition to these, it has been the privilege of the <name reg="US State Department" type="org">Department of State</name> to gain the assent, in principle, of no less than 31 nations, representing four–fifths of the population of the world, to the negotiation of treaties by which it shall be agreed that whenever differences of interest or of policy arise which can not be resolved by the ordinary processes of diplomacy they shall be publically analyzed, discussed, and reported upon by a tribunal chosen by the parties before either nation determines its course of action.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">There is only one possible standard by which to determine controversies between the <place reg="The United States of America" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> and other nations, and that is compounded of these two elements: Our own honor and our obligations to the peace of the world. A test so compounded ought easily to be made to govern both the establishment of new treaty obligations and the interpretation of those already assumed.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">There is but one cloud upon our horizon. That has shown itself to the south of us, and hangs over Mexico. There can be no certain prospect of peace in America until <person refurl="x4002421" reg="Victoriano Huerta" link-pointer-type="person">Gen. Huerta</person> has surrendered his usurped authority in Mexico; until it is understood on all hands, indeed, that such pretended governments will not be countenanced or dealt with by the Government of the <place reg="The United States of America" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place>. We are the friends of constitutional government in America; we are more than its friends, we are its champions; because in no other way can our neighbors, to whom we would wish in every way to make proof  of our friendship, work out their own development in peace and liberty. Mexico has no Government. The attempt to maintain one at the <place reg="Mexico City, Mexico" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">City of Mexico</place> has broken down, and a mere military despotism has been set up which has hardly more than the semblance of national authority. It originated in the usurpation of <person refurl="x4002421" reg="Victoriano Huerta" link-pointer-type="person">Victoriano Huerta</person>, who, after a brief attempt to play the part of constitutional President, has at last cast aside even the pretense of legal right and declared himself dictator. As a consequence, a condition of affairs now exists in Mexico which has made it doubtful whether even the most elementary and fundamental rights either of her own people or of the citizens of other countries resident within her territory can long be successfully safeguarded, and which threatens, if long continued , to imperil the interests of peace, order, and tolerable life in the lands immediately to the south of us. Even if the usurper had succeeded in his purposes, in despite of the constitution of the Republic and the rights of its people, he would have set up nothing but a precarious and hateful power, which could have lasted but a little while, and whose eventual downfall would have left the country in a more deplorable condition than ever. But he has not succeeded. He has forfeited the respect and the moral support even of those who were at one time willing to see him succeed. Little by little be has been completely isolated. By a little every day his power and prestige are crumbling and the collapse is not far away. We shall not, I believe, be obliged to alter our policy of watchful waiting. And then, when the end comes, we shall hope to see constitutional order restored in distressed Mexico by the concert and energy of such of her leaders as prefer the liberty of their people to their own ambitions.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I turn to matters of domestic concern. You already have under consideration a bill for the reform of our system of banking and currency, for which the country waits with impatience, as for something fundamental to its whole business life and necessary to set credit free from arbitrary and artificial restraints. I need not say how earnestly I hope for its early enactment into law. I take leave to beg that the whole energy and attention of the <name reg="US Senate" type="org">Senate</name> be concentrated upon it till the matter is successfully disposed of. And yet, I feel that the request is not needed—that the Members of that great House need no urging in this service to the country.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I present to you, in addition, the urgent necessity that special provision be made also for facilitating the credits needed by the farmers of the country. The pending currency bill does the farmers a great service. It puts them upon an equal footing with other business men and masters of enterprise, as it should; and upon its passage they will find themselves quit of many of the difficulties which now hamper them in the field of credit. The farmers, of course, ask and should be given no special privilege, such as extending to them the credit of the Government itself. What they need and should obtain is legislation which will make their own abundant and substantial credit resources available as a foundation for joint, concerted local action in their own behalf in getting the capital they must use. It is to this we should now address ourselves.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">It has, singularly enough, come to pass that we have allowed the industry of our farms to lag behind the other activities of the country in its development. I need not stop to tell you how fundamental to the life of the Nation is the production of its food. Our thoughts may ordinarily be concentrated upon the cities and the hives of industry, upon the cries of the crowded market place and the clangor of the factory, but it is from the quiet interspaces of the open valleys and the free hillsides that we draw the sources of life and of prosperity, from the farm and the ranch, from the forest and the mine. Without these every street would be silent, every office deserted, every factory fallen into disrepair. And yet the farmer does not stand upon the same footing with the forester and the miner in the market of credit. He is the servant of the seasons. Nature determines how long he must wait for his crops, and will not be hurried in her processes. He may give his note, but the season of its maturity depends upon the season when his crop matures, lies at the gates of the market where his products are sold. And the security he gives is of a character not known in the broker’s office or as familiarly as it might be on the counter of the banker.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The <name reg="US Agriculture Department" type="person">Agricultural Department</name> of the Government is seeking to assist as never before to make farming an efficient business, of wide cooperative effort, in quick touch with the markets for foodstuffs. The farmers and the Government will henceforth work together as real partners in this field, where we now begin to see our way very clearly and where many intelligent plans are already being put into execution. The <name reg="US Treasury Department" type="org">Treasury of the United States</name> has, but a timely and well–considered distribution of its deposits, facilitated the moving of the crops in the present season and prevented the scarcity of available funds too often experienced at such times. But we must not allow ourselves to depend upon extraordinary expedients. We must add the means by which the farmer may make his credit constantly and easily available and command when he will the capital by which to support and expand his business. We lag behind many other great countries of the modern world in attempting to do this. Systems of rural credit have been studied and developed on the other side of the water while we left our farmers to shift for themselves in the ordinary  money market. You have but to look about you in any rural district to see the result, the handicap and embarrassment which have been put upon those who produce our food.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Conscious of this backwardness and neglect on our part, the Congress recently authorized the creation of a special commission to study the various systems of rural credit which have been put into operation in Europe, and this commission is already prepared to report. Its report ought to make it easier for us to determine what methods will be best suited to our own farmers. I hope and believe that the committees of the <name reg="US Senate" type="org">Senate</name> and <name reg="US House of Representatives" type="person">House</name> will address themselves to this matter with the most fruitful results, and I believe that the studies and recently formed plans of the <name reg="US Agriculture Department" type="person">Deparment of Agriculture</name> may be made to serve them very greatly in their work of framing appropriate and adequate legislation. It would be indiscreet and presumptuous in anyone to dogmatize upon so great and many–sided a question, but I feel confident that common counsel will produce the results we must all desire.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Turn from the farm to the world of business which centers in the city and in the factory, and I think that all thoughtful observers will agree that the immediate service we owe the business communities of  the country is to prevent private monopoly more effectually than it has yet been prevented. I think it will be easily agreed that we should let the Sherman antitrust law stand, unaltered, as it is, with its debatable ground about it, but that we should as much as possible reduce the area of that debatable ground by further and more explicit legislation; and should also supplement that great act by legislation which will not only clarify it but also facilitate its administration and make it fairer to all concerned. No doubt we shall all wish, and the country will expect, this to be the central subject of our deliberations during the present session; but it is  a subject so many–sided and so deserving of careful and discriminating discussion that I shall take the liberty of addressing you upon it in a special message at a later date than this. It is of capital importance that the business men of this country should be relieved of all uncertainties of law with regard to their enterprises and investments and a clear path indicated which they can travel without anxiety. It is as important that they should be relieved of embarrassment and set free to prosper as that private monopoly should be destroyed. The ways of action should be thrown wide open.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I turn to a subject which I hope can be handled promptly and without serious controversy of any kind. I mean the method of selecting nominees for the Presidency of the <place reg="The United States of America" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place>. I feel confident that I do not misinterpret the wishes or the expectations of the country when I urge the prompt enactment of legislation which will provide for primary elections throughout the country at which the voters of the several parties may choose their nominees for the Presidency without the intervention of nominating conventions. I venture the suggestion that this legislation should provide for the retention of party conventions, but only for the purpose of declaring and accepting the verdict of the primaries and formulating the platforms of the parties; and I suggest that these conventions should consist not of delegates chosen for this single purpose, but of the nominees for Congress, the nominees for vacant seats in the <name reg="US Senate" type="org">Senate</name> of the <place reg="The United States of America" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place>, the Senators whose terms have not yet closed, the national committees, and the candidates for the Presidency themselves, in order that platforms may be framed by those responsible to the people for carrying them into effect.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">These are all matters of vital domestic concern, and besides them, outside the charmed circle of our own national life in which our affections command us, as well as our consciences, there stand out our obligations toward our territories over sea. Here we are trustees. <place reg="Puerto Rico" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Porto Rico</place>, Hawaii, the Philippines, are ours, indeed, but not ours to do what we please with. Such territories, once regarded as mere possessions, are no longer to be selfishly exploited; they are part of the domain of public conscience and of serviceable and enlightened statesmanship. We must administer them for the people who live in them and with the same sense of responsibility to them as toward our own people in our domestic affairs. No doubt we shall successfully enough bind <place reg="Puerto Rico" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Porto Rico</place> and the Hawaiian Islands to ourselves by ties of justice and interest and affection, but the performance of our duty toward the Philippines is a more difficult and debatable matter. We can satisfy the obligations of generous justice toward the people of <place reg="Puerto Rico" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Porto Rico</place> by giving them the ample and familiar rights and privileges accorded our own citizens in our own territories and our obligations toward the people of Hawaii by perfecting the provisions for self–government already granted them, but in the Philippines we must go further. We must hold steadily in view their ultimate independence, and we must move toward the time of that independence as steadily as the way can be cleared and the foundations thoughtfully and permanently laid.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Acting under the authority conferred upon the President by Congress, I have already accorded the people of the islands a majority in both houses of their legislative body by appointing five instead of four native citizens to the membership of the commission. I believe that in this way we shall make proof of their capacity in counsel and their sense of responsibility in the exercise of political power, and that the success of this step will be sure to clear our view for the steps which are to follow. Step by step we should extend and perfect the system of self–government in the islands, making test of them and modifying them as experience discloses their successes and their failures; that we should more and more put under the control of the native citizens of the archipelago the essential instruments of their life, their local instrumentalities of government, their schools, all the common interests of their communities, and so by counsel and experience set up a government which all the world will see to be suitable to a people whose affairs are under their own control. At last, I hope and believe, we are beginning to gain the confidence of the Filipino peoples. By their counsel and experience, rather than by our own, we shall learn how best to serve them and how soon it will be possible and wise to withdraw our supervision. Let us once find the path and set out with firm and confident tread upon it and we shall not wander from it or linger upon it.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">A duty faces us with regard to Alaska which seems to me very pressing and very imperative; perhaps I should say a double duty, for it concerns both the political and the material development of the Territory. The people of Alaska should be given the full Territorial form of government, and Alaska, as a storehouse, should be unlocked. One key to it is a system of railways. These the Government should itself build and administer, and the ports and terminals it should itself control in the interest of all who wish to use them for the service and development of the country and its people.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">But the construction of railways is only the first step; is only thrusting in the key to the storehouse and throwing back the lock and opening the door. How the tempting resources of the country are to be exploited is another matter, to which I shall take the liberty of from time to time calling your attention, for it is a policy which must be worked out by well–considered stages, not upon theory, but upon lines of practical expediency. It is part of our general problem of conservation. We have a freer hand in working out the problem in Alaska than in the States of the Union; and yet the principle and object are the same, wherever we touch it. We must use the resources of the country, not lock them up. There need be no conflict or jealousy as between State and Federal authorities, for there can be no essential difference of purpose between them. The resources in question must be used, but not destroyed or wasted; used, but not monopolized upon any narrow idea of individual rights as against the abiding interests of communities. That a policy can be worked out by conference and concession which will release these resources and yet not jeopard or dissipate them, I for one have no doubt; and it can be done on lines of regulation which need be no less acceptable to the people and governments of the States concerned than to the people and Government of the Nation at large, whose heritage these resources are. We must bend our counsels to this end. A common purpose ought to make agreement easy.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Three or four matters of special importance and significance I beg that you will permit me to mention in closing.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Our Bureau of Mines ought to be equipped and empowered to render even more effectual service than it renders now in improving the conditions of mine labor and making the mines more economically productive as well as more safe. This is an all–important part of the work of conservation; and the conservation of human life and energy lies even nearer to our interest than the preservation from waste of our material resources.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">We owe it, in mere justice to the railway employees of the country, to provide for them a fair and effective employers’ liability act; and a law that we can stand by in this matter will be no less to the advantage of those who administer the railroads of the country than to the advantage of those whom they employ. The experience of a large number of the States abundantly proves that.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">We ought to devote ourselves to meeting pressing demands of plain justice like this as earnestly as to the accomplishment of political and economic reforms. Social justice comes first. Law is the machinery for its realization and is vital only as it expresses and embodies it.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">An international congress for the discussion of all questions that affect safety at sea is now sitting in <place reg="London, England" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">London</place> at the suggestion of our own Government. So soon as the conclusions of that congress can be learned and considered we ought to address ourselves, among other things, to the prompt alleviation of the very unsafe, unjust, and burdensome conditions which now surround the employment of sailors and render it extremely difficult to obtain the services of spirited and competent men such as every ship needs if it is to be safely handled and brought to port.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">May I not express the very real pleasure I have experienced in cooperating with this Congress and sharing with it the labors of common service to which it has devoted itself so unreservedly during the past seven months of uncomplaining concentration upon the business of legislation? Surely it is a proper and pertinent part of my report on “the state of the Union” to express my admiration for the diligence, the good temper, and the full comprehension of public duty which has already been manifested by both the Houses, and I hope that it may not be deemed an impertinent intrusion of myself into the picture if I say with how much and how constant satisfaction I have availed myself of the privilege of putting my time   and energy at their disposal alike in counsel and in action.</p>

                  xml:space="preserve">my report “on the state of the
               Union,”</link> which I had the privilege of reading to you on the
               <date value="1913-12-02">2d of December last</date>, I ventured
            to reserve for discussion at a later date the subject of additional
            legislation regarding the very difficult and intricate matter of
            trusts and monopolies. The time now seems opportune to turn to that
            great question; not only because the currency legislation, which
            absorbed your attention and the attention of the country in
            December, is now disposed of, but also because opinion seems to be
            clearing about us with singular rapidity in this other great field
            of action. In the matter of the currency it cleared suddenly and
            very happily after the much-debated Act was passed; in respect of
            the monopolies which have multiplied about us and in regard to the
            various means by which they have been organized and maintained it
            seems to be coming to a clear and all but universal agreement in
            anticipation of our action, as if by way of preparation, making the
            way easier to see and easier to set out upon with confidence and
            without confusion of counsel.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Legislation has its atmosphere like everything else,
            and the atmosphere of accommodation and mutual understanding which
            we now breathe with so much refreshment is matter of sincere
            congratulation. It ought to make our task very much less difficult
            and embarrassing than it would have been had we been obliged to
            continue to act amidst the atmosphere of suspicion and antagonism
            which has so long made it impossible to approach such questions with
            dispassionate fairness. Constructive legislation, when successful,
            is always the embodiment of convincing experience, and of the mature
            public opinion which finally springs out of that experience.
            Legislation is a business of interpretation, not of origination; and
            it is now plain what the opinion is to which we must give effect in
            this matter. It is not recent or hasty opinion. It springs out of
            the experience of a whole generation. It has clarified itself by
            long contest, and those who for a long time battled with it and
            sought to change it are now frankly and honorably yielding to it and
            seeking to conform their actions to it.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The great business men who organized and financed
            monopoly and those who administered it in actual everyday
            transactions have year after year, until now, either denied its
            existence or justified it as necessary for the effective maintenance
            and development of the vast business processes of the country in the
            modern circumstances of trade and manufacture and finance; but all
            the while opinion has made head against them. The average business
            man is convinced that the ways of liberty are also the ways of peace
            and the ways of success as well; and at last the masters of business
            on the great scale have begun to yield their preference and purpose,
            perhaps their judgment also, in honorable surrender.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">What we are purposing to do, therefore, is, happily,
            not to hamper or interfere with business as enlightened business men
            prefer to do it, or in any sense to put it under the ban. The
            antagonism between business and government is over. We are now about
            to give expression to the best business judgment of
            <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place>, to what we know to be the business
            conscience and honor of the land. The Government and business men
            are ready to meet each other half way in a common effort to square
            business methods with both public opinion and the law. The best
            informed men of the business world condemn the methods and processes
            and consequences of monopoly as we condemn them; and the instinctive
            judgment of the vast majority of business men everywhere goes with
            them. We shall now be their spokesmen. That is the strength of our
            position and the sure prophecy of what will ensue when our
            reasonable work is done.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">When serious contest ends, when men unite in opinion
            and purpose, those who are to change their ways of business joining
            with those who ask for the change, it is possible to effect it in
            the way in which prudent and thoughtful and patriotic men would wish
            to see it brought about, with as few, as slight, as easy and simple
            business readjustments as possible in the circumstances, nothing
            essential disturbed, nothing torn up by the roots, no parts rent
            asunder which can be left in wholesome combination. Fortunately, no
            measures of sweeping or novel change are necessary. It will be
            understood that our object is <render as="italic" rend="inherit">not</render> to
            unsettle business or anywhere seriously to break its established
            courses athwart. On the contrary, we desire the laws we are now
            about to pass to be the bulwarks and safeguards of industry against
            the forces that have disturbed it. What we have to do can be done in
            a new spirit, in thoughtful moderation, without revolution of any
            untoward kind.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">We are all agreed that “private monopoly is
            indefensible and intolerable,” and our programme is founded upon
            that conviction. It will be a comprehensive but not a radical or
            unacceptable programme and these are its items, the changes which
            opinion deliberately sanctions and for which business waits:</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">It waits with acquiescence, in the first place, for
            laws which will effectually prohibit and prevent such interlockings
            of the <render as="italic" rend="inherit">personnel</render> of the directorates of
            great corporations—banks and railroads, industrial, commercial, and
            public service bodies—as in effect result in making those who borrow
            and those who lend practically one and the same, those who sell and
            those who buy but the same persons trading with one another under
            different names and in different combinations, and those who affect
            to compete in fact partners and masters of some whole field of
            business. Sufficient time should be allowed, of course, in which to
            effect these changes of organization without inconvenience or
            confusion.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Such a prohibition will work much more than a mere
            negative good by correcting the serious evils which have arisen
            because, for example, the men who have been the directing spirits of
            the great investment banks have usurped the place which belongs to
            independent industrial management working in its own behoof. It will
            bring new men, new energies, a new spirit of initiative, new blood,
            into the management of our great business enterprises. It will open
            the field of industrial development and origination to scores of men
            who have been obliged to serve when their abilities entitled them to
            direct. It will immensely hearten the young men coming on and will
            greatly enrich the business activities of the whole country.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">In the second place, business men as well as those who
            direct public affairs now recognize, and recognize with painful
            clearness, the great harm and injustice which has been done to many,
            if not all, of the great railroad systems of the country by the way
            in which they have been financed and their own distinctive interests
            subordinated to the interests of the men who financed them and of
            other business enterprises which those men wished to promote. The
            country is ready, therefore, to accept, and accept with relief as
            well as approval, a law which will confer upon the Interstate
            Commerce Commission the power to superintend and regulate the
            financial operations by which the railroads are henceforth to be
            supplied with the money they need for their proper development to
            meet the rapidly growing requirements of the country for increased
            and improved facilities of transportation. We can not postpone
            action in this matter without leaving the railroads exposed to many
            serious handicaps and hazards; and the prosperity of the railroads
            and the prosperity of the country are inseparably connected. Upon
            this question those who are chiefly responsible for the actual
            management and operation of the railroads have spoken very plainly
            and very earnestly, with a purpose we ought to be quick to accept.
            It will be one step, and a very important one, toward the necessary
            separation of the business of production from the business of
            transportation.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The business of the country awaits also, has long
            awaited and has suffered because it could not obtain, further and
            more explicit legislative definition of the policy and meaning of
            the existing antitrust law. Nothing hampers business like
            uncertainty. Nothing daunts or discourages it like the necessity to
            take chances, to run the risk of falling under the condemnation of
            the law before it can make sure just what the law is. Surely we are
            sufficiently familiar with the actual processes and methods of
            monopoly and of the many hurtful restraints of trade to make
            definition possible, at any rate up to the limits of what experience
            has disclosed. These practices, being now abundantly disclosed, can
            be explicitly and item by item forbidden by statute in such terms as
            will practically eliminate uncertainty, the law itself and the
            penalty being made equally plain.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">And the business men of the country desire something
            more than that the menace of legal process in these matters be made
            explicit and intelligible. They desire the advice, the definite
            guidance and information which can be supplied by an administrative
            body, an interstate trade commission.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The opinion of the country would instantly approve of
            such a commission. It would not wish to see it empowered to make
            terms with monopoly or in any sort to assume control of business, as
            if the Government made itself responsible. It demands such a
            commission only as an indispensable instrument of information and
            publicity, as a clearing house for the facts by which both the
            public mind and the managers of great business undertakings should
            be guided, and as an instrumentality for doing justice to business
            where the processes of the courts or the natural forces of
            correction outside the courts are inadequate to adjust the remedy to
            the wrong in a way that will meet all the equities and circumstances
            of the case.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Producing industries, for example, which have passed
            the point up to which combination may be consistent with the public
            interest and the freedom of trade, can not always be dissected into
            their component units as readily as railroad companies or similar
            organizations can be. Their dissolution by ordinary legal process
            may oftentimes involve financial consequences likely to overwhelm
            the security market and bring upon it breakdown and confusion. There
            ought to be an administrative commission capable of directing and
            shaping such corrective processes, not only in aid of the courts but
            also by independent suggestion, if necessary.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Inasmuch as our object and the spirit of our action in
            these matters is to meet business half way in its processes of
            self-correction and disturb its legitimate course as little as
            possible, we ought to see to it, and the judgment of practical and
            sagacious men of affairs everywhere would applaud us if we did see
            to it, that penalties and punishments should fall, not upon business
            itself, to its confusion and interruption, but upon the individuals
            who use the instrumentalities of business to do things which public
            policy and sound business practice condemn. Every act of business is
            done at the command or upon the initiative of some ascertainable
            person or group of persons. These should be held individually
            responsible and the punishment should fall upon them, not upon the
            business organization of which they make illegal use. It should be
            one of the main objects of our legislation to divest such persons of
            their corporate cloak and deal with them as with those who do not
            represent their corporations, but merely by deliberate intention
            break the law. Business men the country through would, I am sure,
            applaud us if we were to take effectual steps to see that the
            officers and directors of great business bodies were prevented from
            bringing them and the business of the country into disrepute and
            danger.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Other questions remain which will need very thoughtful
            and practical treatment. Enterprises, in these modern days of great
            individual fortunes, are oftentimes interlocked, not by being under
            the control of the same directors, but by the fact that the greater
            part of their corporate stock is owned by a single person or group
            of persons who are in some way intimately related in interest. We
            are agreed, I take it, that holding <render as="italic" rend="inherit">companies</render> should be prohibited, but what of the
            controlling private ownership of individuals or actually cooperative
            groups of individuals? Shall the private owners of capital stock be
            suffered to be themselves in effect holding companies? We do not
            wish, I suppose, to forbid the purchase of stocks by any person who
            pleases to buy them in such quantities as he can afford, or in any
            way arbitrarily to limit the sale of stocks to bona fide purchasers.
            Shall we require the owners of stock, when their voting power in
            several companies which ought to be independent of one another would
            constitute actual control, to make election in which of them they
            will exercise their right to vote? This question I venture for your
            consideration.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">There is another matter in which imperative
            considerations of justice and fair play suggest thoughtful remedial
            action. Not only do many of the combinations effected or sought to
            be effected in the industrial world work an injustice upon the
            public in general; they also directly and seriously injure the
            individuals who are put out of business in one unfair way or another
            by the many dislodging and exterminating forces of combination. I
            hope that we shall agree in giving private individuals who claim to
            have been injured by these processes the right to found their suits
            for redress upon the facts and judgments proved and entered in suits
            by the Government where the Government has upon its own initiative
            sued the combinations complained of and won its suit, and that the
            statute of limitations shall be suffered to run against such
            litigants only from the date of the conclusion of the Government’s
            action. It is not fair that the private litigant should be obliged
            to set up and establish again the facts which the Government has
            proved. He can not afford, he has not the power, to make use of such
            processes of inquiry as the Government has command of. Thus shall
            individual justice be done while the processes of business are
            rectified and squared with the general conscience.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I have laid the case before you, no doubt as it lies
            in your own mind, as it lies in the thought of the country. What
            must every candid man say of the suggestions I have laid before you,
            of the plain obligations of which I have reminded you? That these
            are new things for which the country is not prepared? No; but that
            they are old things, now familiar, and must of course be undertaken
            if we are to square our laws with the thought and desire of the
            country. Until these things are done, conscientious business men the
            country over will be unsatisfied. They are in these things our
            mentors and colleagues. We are now about to write the additional
            articles of our constitution of peace, the peace that is honor and
            freedom and prosperity.</p>

            <render as="smallcap" rend="inherit">Gentlemen of the Congress:</render>
         </p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I have come to you upon an errand which can be very
            briefly performed, but I beg that you will not measure its
            importance by the number of sentences in which I state it. No
            communication I have addressed to the Congress carried with it
            graver or more far-reaching implications as to the interest of the
            country, and I come now to speak upon a matter with regard to which
            I am charged in a peculiar degree, by the Constitution itself, with
            personal responsibility.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I have come to ask you for the repeal of that
            provision of the Panama Canal Act of <date value="1912-08-24">August
               24, 1912</date>, which exempts vessels engaged in the coastwise
            trade of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> from payment of tolls, and
            to urge upon you the justice, the wisdom, and the large policy of
            such arepeal with the utmost earnestness of which I am capable.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">In my own judgment, very fully considered and maturely
            formed, that exemption constitutes a mistaken economic policy from
            every point of view, and is, moreover, in plain contravention of the
            treaty with <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Great Britain</place> concerning the canal
            concluded on <date value="1901-11-18">November 18, 1901</date>. But
            I have not come to urge upon you my personal views. I have come to
            state to you a fact and a situation. Whatever may be our own
            differences of opinion concerning this much debated measure, its
            meaning is not debated outside the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place>.
            Everywhere else the language of the treaty is given but one
            interpretation, and that interpretation precludes the exemption I am
            asking you to repeal. We consented to the treaty; its language we
            accepted, if we did not originate it; and we are too big, too
            powerful, too self-respecting a nation to interpret with a too
            strained or refined reading the words of our own promises just
            because we have power enough to give us leave to read them as we
            please. The large thing to do is the only thing we can afford to do,
            a voluntary withdrawal from a position everywhere questioned and
            misunderstood. We ought to reverse our action without raising the
            question whether we were right or wrong, and so once more deserve
            our reputation for generosity and for the redemption of every
            obligation without quibble or hesitation.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I ask this of you in support of the foreign policy of
            the administration. I shall not know how to deal with other matters
            of even greater delicacy and nearer consequence if you do not grant
            it to me in ungrudging measure.</p>

         <p rend="noindent" xml:space="preserve"><render as="smallcap" rend="inherit">Gentlemen of the
            Congress</render>:</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">It is my duty to call your attention to a situation
            which has arisen in our dealings with <person refurl="x4002421" reg="Victoriano Huerta" link-pointer-type="person">General
               Victoriano Huerta</person> at <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Mexico City</place> which
            calls for action, and to ask your advice and cooperation in acting
            upon it. On the <date value="1914-04-09">9th of April</date> a
            paymaster of the <name type="ship">U. S. S. <render as="italic" rend="inherit">Dolphin</render></name> landed at the Iturbide Bridge landing
            at <place reg="Tampico, Mexico" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Tampico</place> with a whaleboat and
            boat’s crew to take off certain supplies needed by his ship, and
            while engaged in loading the boat was arrested by an officer and
            squad of men of the army of <person refurl="x4002421" reg="Victoriano Huerta" link-pointer-type="person">General
            Huerta</person>. Neither the paymaster nor anyone of the boat’s crew
            was armed. Two of the men were in the boat when the arrest took
            place and were obliged to leave it and submit to be taken into
            custody, notwithstanding the fact that the boat carried, both at her
            bow and at her stern, the flag of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place>.
            The officer who made the arrest was proceeding up one of the streets
            of the town with his prisoners when met by an officer of higher
            authority, who ordered him to return to the landing and await
            orders; and within an hour and a half from the time of the arrest
            orders were received from the commander of the Huertista forces at
               <place reg="Tampico, Mexico" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Tampico</place> for the release of
            the paymaster and his men. The release was followed by apologies
            from the commander and later by an expression of regret by <person refurl="x4002421" reg="Victoriano Huerta" link-pointer-type="person">General Huerta</person> himself.
               <person refurl="x4002421" reg="Victoriano Huerta" link-pointer-type="person">General Huerta</person> urged that
            martial law obtained at the time at <place reg="Tampico, Mexico" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Tampico</place>; that orders had been issued that no one should
            be allowed to land at the Iturbide Bridge; and that our sailors had
            no right to land there. Our naval commanders at the port had not
            been notified of any such prohibition; and, even if they had been,
            the only justifiable course open to the local authorities would have
            been to request the paymaster and his crew to withdraw and to lodge
            a protest with the commanding officer of the fleet. <person refurl="x4003539" reg="Henry T. Mayo" link-pointer-type="person">Admiral Mayo</person> regarded the arrest as so
            serious an affront that he was not satisfied with the apologies
            offered, but demanded that the flag of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United
            States</place> be saluted with special ceremony by the military
            commander of the port.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The incident can not be regarded as a trivial one,
            especially as two of the men arrested were taken from the boat
            itself—that is to say, from the territory of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United
               States</place>—but had it stood by itself it might have been
            attributed to the ignorance or arrogance of a single officer.
            Unfortunately, it was not an isolated case. A series of incidents
            have recently occurred which can not but create the impression that
            the representatives of <person refurl="x4002421" reg="Victoriano Huerta" link-pointer-type="person">General
            Huerta</person> were willing to go out of their way to show
            disregard for the dignity and rights of this Government and felt
            perfectly safe in doing what they pleased, making free to show in
            many ways their irritation and contempt. A few days after the
            incident at <place reg="Tampico, Mexico" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Tampico</place> an orderly
            from the <name type="ship">U. S. S. <render as="italic" rend="inherit">Minnesota</render></name> was arrested at <place reg="Vera Cruz, Mexico" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Vera Cruz</place> while ashore in uniform
            to obtain the ship’s mail, and was for a time thrown into jail. An
            official dispatch from this Government to its embassy at
               <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Mexico City</place> was withheld by the authorities of the
            telegraphic service until peremptorily demanded by our chargé
            d’affaires in person. So far as I can learn, such wrongs and
            annoyances have been suffered to occur only against representatives
            of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place>. I have heard of no complaints
            from other Governments of similar treatment. Subsequent explanations
            and formal apologies did not and could not alter the popular
            impression, which it is possible it had been the object of the
            Huertista authorities to create, that the Government of the
               <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> was being singled out, and might be
            singled out with impunity, for slights and affronts in retaliation
            for its refusal to recognize the pretensions of <person refurl="x4002421" reg="Victoriano Huerta" link-pointer-type="person">General Huerta</person> to be regarded
            as the constitutional provisional President of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Republic
               of Mexico</place>.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The manifest danger of such a situation was that such
            offenses might grow from bad to worse until something happened of so
            gross and intolerable a sort as to lead directly and inevitably to
            armed conflict. It was necessary that the apologies of <person refurl="x4002421" reg="Victoriano Huerta" link-pointer-type="person">General Huerta</person> and his
            representatives should go much further, that they should be such as
            to attract the attention of the whole population to their
            significance, and such as to impress upon <person refurl="x4002421" reg="Victoriano Huerta" link-pointer-type="person">General
            Huerta</person> himself the necessity of seeing to it that no
            further occasion for explanations and professed regrets should
            arise. I, therefore, felt it my duty to sustain <person refurl="x4003539" reg="Henry T. Mayo" link-pointer-type="person">Admiral Mayo</person> in the whole of his demand
            and to insist that the flag of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place>
            should be saluted in such a way as to indicate a new spirit and
            attitude on the part of the Huertistas.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Such a salute <person refurl="x4002421" reg="Victoriano Huerta" link-pointer-type="person">General
            Huerta</person> has refused, and I have come to ask your approval
            and support in the course I now purpose to pursue.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">This Government can, I earnestly hope, in no
            circumstances be forced into war with the people of
            <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Mexico</place>. <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Mexico</place> is torn by civil
            strife. If we are to accept the tests of its own constitution, it
            has no government. <person refurl="x4002421" reg="Victoriano Huerta" link-pointer-type="person">General Huerta</person> has set his
            power up in the <place reg="Mexico City" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">City of Mexico</place>,
            such as it is, without right and by methods for which there can be
            no justification. Only part of the country is under his control. If
            armed conflict should unhappily come as a result of his attitude of
            personal resentment toward this Government, we should be fighting
            only <person refurl="x4002421" reg="Victoriano Huerta" link-pointer-type="person">General Huerta</person> and those who
            adhere to him and give him their support, and our object would be
            only to restore to the people of the distracted <place reg="Mexico" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Republic</place> the opportunity to set up again their own laws
            and their own government.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">But I earnestly hope that war is not now in question.
            I believe that I speak for the American people when I say that we do
            not desire to control in any degree the affairs of our sister <place reg="Mexico" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Republic</place>. Our feeling for the people of
               <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Mexico</place> is one of deep and genuine friendship, and
            everything that we have so far done or refrained from doing has
            proceeded from our desire to help them, not to hinder or embarrass
            them. We would not wish even to exercise the good offices of
            friendship without their welcome and consent. The people of
               <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Mexico</place> are entitled to settle their own domestic
            affairs in their own way, and we sincerely desire to respect their
            right. The present situation need have none of the grave
            implications of interference if we deal with it promptly, firmly,
            and wisely.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">No doubt I could do what is necessary in the
            circumstances to enforce respect for our Government without recourse
            to the Congress, and yet not exceed my constitutional powers as
            President; but I do not wish to act in a matter possibly of so grave
            consequence except in close conference and cooperation with both the
            Senate and House. I, therefore, come to ask your approval that I
            should use the armed forces of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> in
            such ways and to such an extent as may be necessary to obtain from
               <person refurl="x4002421" reg="Victoriano Huerta" link-pointer-type="person">General Huerta</person> and his
            adherents the fullest recognition of the rights and dignity of the
               <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place>, even amidst the distressing
            conditions now unhappily obtaining in <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Mexico</place>.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">There can in what we do be no thought of aggression or
            of selfish aggrandizement. We seek to maintain the dignity and
            authority of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> only because we wish
            always to keep our great influence unimpaired for the uses of
            liberty, both in the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> and wherever else
            it may be employed for the benefit of mankind.</p>

         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Mr. <render as="smallcap" rend="inherit">Secretary</render>: I know
            that the feelings which characterize all who stand about me and the
            whole Nation at this hour are not feelings which can be suitably
            expressed in terms of attempted oratory or eloquence. They are
            things too deep for ordinary speech. For my own part, I have a
            singular mixture of feelings. The feeling that is uppermost is one
            of profound grief that these lads should have had to go to their
            death; and yet there is mixed with that grief a profound pride that
            they should have gone as they did, and, if I may say it out of my
            heart, a touch of envy of those who were permitted so quietly, so
            nobly, to do their duty. Have you thought of it, men? Here is the
            roster of the Navy—the list of the men, officers and enlisted men
            and marines—and suddenly there swim nineteen stars out of the
            list—men who have suddenly been lifted into a firmament of memory
            where we shall always see their names shine, not because they called
            upon us to admire them, but because they served us, without asking
            any questions and in the performance of a duty which is laid upon us
            as well as upon them.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Duty is not an uncommon thing, gentlemen. Men are
            performing it in the ordinary walks of life all around us all the
            time, and they are making great sacrifices to perform it. What gives
            men like these peculiar distinction is not merely that they did
            their duty, but that their duty had nothing to do with them or their
            own personal and peculiar interests. They did not give their lives
            for themselves. They gave their lives for us, because we called upon
            them as a Nation to perform an unexpected duty. That is the way in
            which men grow distinguished, and that is the only way, by serving
            somebody else than themselves. And what greater thing could you
            serve than a Nation such as this we love and are proud of? Are you
            sorry for these lads? Are you sorry for the way they will be
            remembered? Does it not quicken your pulses to think of the list of
            them? I hope to God none of you may join the list, but if you do you
            will join an immortal company.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">So, while we are profoundly sorrowful, and while there
            goes out of our hearts a very deep and affectionate sympathy for the
            friends and relatives of these lads who for the rest of their lives
            shall mourn them, though with a touch of pride, we know why we do
            not go away from this occasion cast down, but with our heads lifted
            and our eyes on the future of this country, with absolute confidence
            of how it will be worked out. Not only upon the mere vague future of
            this country, but upon the immediate future. We have gone down to
               <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Mexico</place> to serve mankind if we can find out the
            way. We do not want to fight the Mexicans. We want to serve the
            Mexicans if we can, because we know how we would like to be free,
            and how we would like to be served if there were friends standing by
            in such case ready to serve us. A war of aggression is not a war in
            which it is a proud thing to die, but a war of service is a thing in
            which it is a proud thing to die.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Notice how truly these men were of our blood. I mean
            of our American blood, which is not drawn from any one country,
            which is not drawn from any one stock, which is not drawn from any
            one language of the modern world; but free men everywhere have sent
            their sons and their brothers and their daughters to this country in
            order to make that great compounded Nation which consists of all the
            sturdy elements and of all the best elements of the whole globe. I
            listened again to this list of the dead with a profound interest
            because of the mixture of the names, for the names bear the marks of
            the several national stocks from which these men came. But they are
            not Irishmen or Germans or Frenchmen or Hebrews or Italians any
            more. They were not when they went to <place reg="Vera Cruz, Mexico" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Vera Cruz</place>; they were Americans, every one of them, and
            with no difference in their Americanism because of the stock from
            which they came. They were in a peculiar sense of our blood, and
            they proved it by showing that they were of our spirit—that no
            matter what their derivation, no matter where their people came
            from, they thought and wished and did the things that were American;
            and the flag under which they served was a flag in which all the
            blood of mankind is united to make a free Nation.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">War, gentlemen, is only a sort of dramatic
            representation, a sort of dramatic symbol, of a thousand forms of
            duty. I never went into battle; I never was under fire; but I fancy
            that there are some things just as hard to do as to go under fire. I
            fancy that it is just as hard to do your duty when men are sneering
            at you as when they are shooting at you. When they shoot at you,
            they can only take your natural life; when they sneer at you, they
            can wound your living heart, and men who are brave enough, steadfast
            enough, steady in their principles enough, to go about their duty
            with regard to their fellow men, no matter whether there are hisses
            or cheers, men who can do what <person refurl="x4005165" reg="Rudyard Kipling" link-pointer-type="person">Rudyard
            Kipling</person> in one of his poems wrote, “Meet with triumph and
            disaster and treat those two impostors just the same,” are men for a
            nation to be proud of. Morally speaking, disaster and triumph are
            imposters. The cheers of the moment are not what a man ought to
            think about, but the verdict of his conscience and of the
            consciences of mankind.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">When I look at you, I feel as if I also and we all
            were enlisted men. Not enlisted in your particular branch of the
            service, but enlisted to serve the country, no matter what may come,
            even though we may sacrifice our lives in the arduous endeavor. We
            are expected to put the utmost energy of every power that we have
            into the service of our fellow men, never sparing ourselves, not
            condescending to think of what is going to happen to ourselves, but
            ready, if need be, to go to the utter length of complete
            self-sacrifice.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">As I stand and look at you to-day and think of these
            spirits that have gone from us, I know that the road is clearer for
            the future. These boys have shown us the way, and it is easier to
            walk on it because they have gone before and shown us how. May God
            grant to all of us that vision of patriotic service which here in
            solemnity and grief and pride is borne in upon our hearts and
            consciences!</p>

         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve"><render as="smallcap" rend="inherit">Mr. Secretary, Ladies, and
               Gentlemen</render>: I esteem it a privilege to be present on this
            interesting occasion, and I am very much tempted to anticipate some
            part of what the orators of the day will say about the character of
            the great man whose memory we celebrate. If I were to attempt an
            historical address, I might, however, be led too far afield. I am
            going to take the liberty, therefore, of drawing a few inferences
            from the significance of this occasion.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I think that we can never be present at a ceremony of
            this kind, which carries our thought back to the great <abbr expan="American Revolution">Revolution</abbr>, by means of which
            our Government was set up, without feeling that it is an occasion of
            reminder, of renewal, of refreshment, when we turn our thoughts
            again to the great issues which were presented to the little Nation
            which then asserted its independence to the world; to which it spoke
            both in eloquent representations of its cause and in the sound of
            arms, and ask ourselves what it was that these men fought for. No
            one can turn to the career of <person refurl="x4003399" reg="John Barry" link-pointer-type="person">Commodore
               Barry</person> without feeling a touch of the enthusiasm with
            which he devoted an originating mind to the great cause which he
            intended to serve, and it behooves us, living in this age when no
            man can question the power of the Nation, when no man would dare to
            doubt its right and its determination to act for itself, to ask what
            it was that filled the hearts of these men when they set the Nation
            up.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">For patriotism, ladies and gentlemen, is in my mind
            not merely a sentiment. There is a certain effervescence, I suppose,
            which ought to be permitted to those who allow their hearts to speak
            in the celebration of the glory and majesty of their country, but
            the country can have no glory and no majesty unless there be a deep
            principle and conviction back of the enthusiasm. Patriotism is a
            principle, not a mere sentiment. No man can be a true patriot who
            does not feel himself shot through and through with a deep ardor for
            what his country stands for, what its existence means, what its
            purpose is declared to be in its history and in its policy. I recall
            those solemn lines of the poet <person refurl="x4003615" reg="Alfred Tennyson" link-pointer-type="person">Tennyson</person> in which he tries to give voice to his
            conception of what it is that stirs within a nation: “Some sense of
            duty, something of a faith, some reverence for the laws ourselves
            have made, some patient force to change them when we will, some
            civic manhood firm against the crowd;” steadfastness, clearness of
            purpose, courage, persistency, and that uprightness which comes from
            the clear thinking of men who wish to serve not themselves but their
            fellow men.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">What does the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> stand for,
            then, that our hearts should be stirred by the memory of the men who
            set her Constitution up? <person refurl="x4003399" reg="John Barry" link-pointer-type="person">John Barry</person> fought, like
            every other man in the Revolution, in order that
            <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> might be free to make her own life without
            interruption or disturbance from any other quarter. You can sum the
            whole thing up in that, that <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> had a right to
            her own self-determined life; and what are our corollaries from
            that? You do not have to go back to stir your thoughts again with
            the issues of the Revolution. Some of the issues of the Revolution
            were not the cause of it, but merely the occasion for it. There are
            just as vital things stirring now that concern the existence of the
            Nation as were stirring then, and every man who worthily stands in
            this presence should examine himself and see whether he has the full
            conception of what it means that <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> should live
            her own life. <person refurl="x4000491" reg="George Washington" link-pointer-type="person">Washington</person> saw it when he
            wrote his farewell address. It was not merely because of passing and
            transient circumstances that <person refurl="x4000491" reg="George Washington" link-pointer-type="person">Washington</person> said that we must keep free from entangling
            alliances. It was because he saw that no country had yet set its
            face in the same direction in which <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> had set
            her face. We can not form alliances with those who are not going our
            way; and in our might and majesty and in the confidence and
            definiteness of our own purpose we need not and we should not form
            alliances with any nation in the world. Those who are right, those
            who study their consciences in determining their policies, those who
            hold their honor higher than their advantage, do not need alliances.
            You need alliances when you are not strong, and you are weak only
            when you are not true to yourself. You are weak only when you are in
            the wrong; you are weak only when you are afraid to do the right;
            you are weak only when you doubt your cause and the majesty of a
            nation’s might asserted.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">There is another corollary. <person refurl="x4003399" reg="John Barry" link-pointer-type="person">John Barry</person> was an Irishman, but his heart crossed the Atlantic
            with him. He did not leave it in <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Ireland</place>. And the
            test of all of us—for all of us had our origins on the other side of
            the sea—is whether we will assist in enabling <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place>
            to live her separate and independent life, retaining our ancient
            affections, indeed, but determining everything that we do by the
            interests that exist on this side of the sea. Some Americans need
            hyphens in their names, because only part of them has come over; but
            when the whole man has come over, heart and thought and all, the
            hyphen drops of its own weight out of his name. This man was not an
            Irish-American; he was an Irishman who became an American. I venture
            to say if he voted he voted with regard to the questions as they
            looked on this side of the water and not as they affected the other
            side; and that is my infallible test of a genuine American, that
            when he votes or when he acts or when he fights his heart and his
            thought are centered nowhere but in the emotions and the purposes
            and the policies of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place>.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">This man illustrates for me all the splendid strength
            which we brought into this country by the magnet of freedom. Men
            have been drawn to this country by the same thing that has made us
            love this country—by the opportunity to live their own lives and to
            think their own thoughts and to let their whole natures expand with
            the expansion of a free and mighty Nation. We have brought out of
            the stocks of all the world all the best impulses and have
            appropriated them and Americanized them and translated them into the
            glory and majesty of a great country.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">So, ladies and gentlemen, when we go out from this
            presence we ought to take this idea with us that we, too, are
            devoted to the purpose of enabling <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> to live
            her own life, to be the justest, the most progressive, the most
            honorable, the most enlightened Nation in the world. Any man that
            touches our honor is our enemy. Any man who stands in the way of the
            kind of progress which makes for human freedom can not call himself
            our friend. Any man who does not feel behind him the whole push and
            rush and compulsion that filled men’s hearts in the time of the
            Revolution is no American. No man who thinks first of himself and
            afterwards of his country can call himself an American.

         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve"><render as="smallcap" rend="inherit">Ladies and Gentlemen</render>: I
            have not come here to-day with a prepared address. The committee in
            charge of the exercises of the day have graciously excused me on the
            grounds of public obligations from preparing such an address, but I
            will not deny myself the privilege of joining with you in an
            expression of gratitude and admiration for the men who perished for
            the sake of the Union. They do not need our praise. They do not need
            that our admiration should sustain them. There is no immortality
            that is safer than theirs. We come not for their sakes but for our
            own, in order that we may drink at the same springs of inspiration
            from which they themselves drank.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">A peculiar <sic corr="privilege">privileg</sic> came
            to the men who fought for the Union. There is no other civil war in
            history, ladies and gentlemen, the stings of which were removed
            before the men who did the fighting passed from the stage of life.
            So that we owe these men something more than a legal reestablishment
            of the Union. We owe them the spiritual reestablishment of the Union
            as well; for they not only reunited States, they reunited the
            spirits of men. That is their unique achievement, unexampled
            anywhere else in the annals of mankind, that the very men whom they
            overcame in battle join in praise and gratitude that the Union was
            saved. There is something peculiarly beautiful and peculiarly
            touching about that. Whenever a man who is still trying to devote
            himself to the service of the Nation comes into a presence like
            this, or into a place like this, his spirit must be peculiarly
            moved. A mandate is laid upon him which seems to speak from the very
            graves themselves. Those who serve this Nation, whether in peace or
            in war, should serve it without thought of themselves. I can never
            speak in praise of war, ladies and gentlemen; you would not desire
            me to do so. But there is this peculiar distinction belonging to the
            soldier, that he goes into an enterprise out of which he himself can
            not get anything at all. He is giving everything that he hath, even
            his life, in order that others may live, not in order that he
            himself may obtain gain and prosperity. And just so soon as the
            tasks of peace are performed in the same spirit of self-sacrifice
            and devotion, peace societies will not be necessary. The very
            organization and spirit of society will be a guaranty of peace.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Therefore this peculiar thing comes about, that we can
            stand here and praise the memory of these soldiers in the interest
            of peace. They set us the example of self-sacrifice, which if
            followed in peace will make it unnecessary that men should follow
            war any more.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">We are reputed to be somewhat careless in our
            discrimination between words in the use of the English language, and
            yet it is interesting to note that there are some words about which
            we are very careful. We bestow the adjective “great” somewhat
            indiscriminately. A man who has made conquest of his fellow men for
            his own gain may display such genius in war, such uncommon qualities
            of organization and leadership that we may call him “great,” but
            there is a word which we reserve for men of another kind and about
            which we are very careful; that is the word “noble.” We never call a
            man “noble” who serves only himself; and if you will look about
            through all the nations of the world upon the statues that men have
            erected—upon the inscribed tablets where they have wished to keep
            alive the memory of the citizens whom they desire most to honor—you
            will find that almost without exception they have erected the statue
            to those who had a splendid surplus of energy and devotion to spend
            upon their fellow men. Nobility exists in <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place>
            without patent. We have no House of Lords, but we have a house of
            fame to which we elevate those who are the noble men of our race,
            who, forgetful of themselves, study and serve the public interest,
            who have the courage to face any number and any kind of adversary,
            to speak what in their hearts they believe to be the truth.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">We admire physical courage, but we admire above all
            things else moral courage. I believe that soldiers will bear me out
            in saying that both come in time of battle. I take it that moral
            courage comes in going in the battle, and the physical courage in
            staying in. There are battles which are just as hard to go into and
            just as hard to stay in as the battles of arms, and if the man will
            but stay and think never of himself there will come a time of
            grateful recollection when men will speak of him not only with
            admiration but with that which goes deeper, with affection and with
            reverence.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">So that this flag calls upon us daily for service, and
            the more quiet and self-denying the service the greater the glory of
            the flag. We are dedicated to freedom, and that freedom means the
            freedom of the human spirit. All free spirits ought to congregate on
            an occasion like this to do homage to the greatness of
               <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> as illustrated by the greatness of her
            sons.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">It has been a privileges, ladies and gentlemen, to
            come and say these simple words, which I am sure are merely putting
            your thought into language. I thank you for the opportunity to lay
            this little wreath of mine upon these consecrated graves.</p>

               <render as="smallcap" rend="inherit">McLaurin Stevens, Ladies and
            Gentlemen</render>:</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I assure you that I am profoundly aware of the solemn
            significance of the thing that has now taken place. The Daughters of
            the Confederacy have presented a memorial of their dead to the
            Government of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place>. I hope that you have
            noted the history of the conception of this idea. It was suggested
            by <personRef refurl="x4005171" reg="William McKinley" link-pointer-type="person">a President</personRef> of the
               <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> who had himself been a distinguished
            officer in the Union Army. It was authorized by an act of Congress
            of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place>. The corner stone of the
            monument was laid by <personRef refurl="x4005084" reg="William H. Taft" link-pointer-type="person">a
            President</personRef> of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> elevated
            to his position by the votes of the party which had chiefly prided
            itself upon sustaining the war for the Union, and who, while
            Secretary of War, had himself given authority to erect it. And, now,
            it has fallen to my lot to accept in the name of the great
            Government, which I am privileged for the time to represent, this
            emblem of a reunited people. I am not so much happy as proud to
            participate in this capacity on such an occasion,—proud that I
            should represent such a people. Am I mistaken, ladies and gentlemen,
            in supposing that nothing of this sort could have occurred in
            anything but a democracy? The people of a democracy are not related
            to their rulers as subjects are related to a government. They are
            themselves the sovereign authority, and as they are neighbors of
            each other, quickened by the same influences and moved by the same
            motives, they can understand each other. They are shot through with
            some of the deepest and profoundest instincts of human sympathy.
            They choose their governments; they select their rulers; they live
            their own life, and they will not have that life disturbed and
            discolored by fraternal misunderstandings. I know that a reuniting
            of spirits like this can take place more quickly in our time than in
            any other because men are now united by an easier transmission of
            those influences which make up the foundations of peace and of
            mutual understanding, but no process can work these effects unless
            there is a conducting medium. The conducting medium in this instance
            is the united heart of a great people. I am not going to detain you
            by trying to repeat any of the eloquent thoughts which have moved us
            this afternoon, for I rejoice in the simplicity of the task which is
            assigned to me. My privilege is this, ladies and gentlemen: To
            declare this chapter in the history of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United
            States</place> closed and ended, and I bid you turn with me with
            your faces to the future, quickened by the memories of the past, but
            with nothing to do with the contests of the past, knowing, as we
            have shed our blood upon opposite sides, we now face and admire one
            another. I do not know how many years ago it was that the Century
            Dictionary was published, but I remember one day in the Century
            Cyclopedia of Names I had occasion to turn to the name of <person refurl="x4005177" reg="Robert E. Lee" link-pointer-type="person">Robert E. Lee</person>, and I found him there in that book
            published in <place reg="New York, NY" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">New York City</place> simply
            described as a great American general. The generosity of our
            judgments did not begin <word altform="today">to-day</word>. The
            generosity of our judgment was made up soon after this great
            struggle was over. Men came and sat together again in the Congress
            and united in all the efforts of peace and of government, and our
            solemn duty is to see that each one of us is in his own
            consciousness and in his own conduct a replica of this great
            reunited people. It is our duty and our privilege to be like the
            country we represent and, speaking no word of malice, no word of
            criticism even, stand shoulder to shoulder to lift the burdens of
            mankind in the future and show the paths of freedom to all the
            world.</p>

         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve"><render as="smallcap" rend="inherit">Mr. Superintendent, Young
               Gentlemen, Ladies and Gentlemen</render>: During the greater part
            of my life I have been associated with young men, and on occasions
            it seems to me without number have faced bodies of youngsters going
            out to take part in the activities of the world, but I have a
            consciousness of a different significance in this occasion from that
            which I have felt on other similar occasions. When I have faced the
            graduating classes at universities I have felt that I was facing a
            great conjecture. They were going out into all sorts of pursuits and
            with every degree of preparation for the particular thing they were
            expecting to do; some without any preparation at all, for they did
            not know what they expected to do. But in facing you I am facing men
            who are trained for a special thing. You know what you are going to
            do, and you are under the eye of the whole Nation in doing it. For
            you, gentlemen, are to be part of the power of the Government of the
               <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place>. There is a very deep and solemn
            significance in that fact, and I am sure that every one of you feels
            it. The moral is perfectly obvious. Be ready and fit for anything
            that you have to do. And keep ready and fit. Do not grow slack. Do
            not suppose that your education is over because you have received
            your diplomas from the academy. Your education has just begun.
            Moreover, you are to have a very peculiar privilege which not many
            of your predecessors have had. You are yourselves going to become
            teachers. You are going to teach those 50,000 fellow countrymen of
            yours who are the enlisted men of the Navy. You are going to make
            them fitter to obey your orders and to serve the country. You are
            going to make them fitter to see what the orders mean in their
            outlook upon life and upon the service; and that is a great
            privilege, for out of you is going the energy and intelligence which
            are going to quicken the whole body of the United States Navy.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I congratulate you upon that prospect, but I want to
            ask you not to get the professional point of view. I would ask it of
            you if you were lawyers; I would ask it of you if you were
            merchants; I would ask it of you whatever you expected to be. Do not
            get the professional point of view. There is nothing narrower or
            more unserviceable than the professional point of view, to have the
            attitude toward life that it centers in your profession. It does
            not. Your profession is only one of the many activities which are
            meant to keep the world straight, and to keep the energy in its
            blood and in its muscle. We are all of us in this world, as I
            understand it, to set forward the affairs of the whole world, though
            we play a special part in that great function. The Navy goes all
            over the world, and I think it is to be congratulated upon having
            that sort of illustration of what the world is and what it contains;
            and inasmuch as you are going all over the world you ought to be the
            better able to see the relation that your country bears to the rest
            of the world.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">It ought to be one of your thoughts all the time that
            you are sample Americans—not merely sample Navy men, not merely
            sample soldiers, but sample Americans—and that you have the point of
            view of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> with regard to her Navy and her Army;
            that she is using them as the instruments of civilization, not as
            the instruments of aggression. The idea of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> is
            to serve humanity, and every time you let the Stars and Stripes free
            to the wind you ought to realize that that is in itself a message
            that you are on an errand which other navies have sometimes
            forgotten; not an errand of conquest, but an errand of service. I
            always have the same thought when I look at the flag of the
               <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place>, for I know something of the history
            of the struggle of mankind for liberty. When I look at that flag it
            seems to me as if the white stripes were strips of parchment upon
            which are written the rights of man, and the red stripes the streams
            of blood by which those rights have been made good. Then in the
            little blue firmament in the corner have swung out the stars of the
            States of the American Union. So, it is, as it were, a sort of
            floating charter that has come down to us from Runnymede, when men
            said, “We will not have masters; we will be a people, and we will
            seek our own liberty.”</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">You are not serving a government, gentlemen; you are
            serving a people. For we who for the time being constitute the
            Government are merely instruments for a little while in the hands of
            a great Nation which chooses whom it will to carry out its decrees
            and who invariably rejects the man who forgets the ideals which it
            intended him to serve. So that I hope that wherever you go you will
            have a generous, comprehending love of the people you come into
            contact with, and will come back and tell us, if you can, what
            service the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> can render to the remotest
            parts of the world; tell us where you see men suffering; tell us
            where you think advice will lift them up; tell us where you think
            that the counsel of statesmen may better the fortunes of unfortunate
            men; always having it in mind that you are champions of what is
            right and fair all ’round for the public welfare, no matter where
            you are, and that it is that you are ready to fight for and not
            merely on the drop of a hat or upon some slight punctillio, but that
            you are champions of your fellow men, particularly of that great
            body one hundred million strong whom you represent in the
               <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place>.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">What do you think is the most lasting impression that
            those boys down at <place reg="Vera Cruz, Mexico" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Vera Cruz</place>
            are going to leave? They have had to use some force—I pray God it
            may not be necessary for them to use any more—but do you think that
            the way they fought is going to be the most lasting impression? Have
            men not fought ever since the world began? Is there anything new in
            using force? The new things in the world are the things that are
            divorced from force. The things that show the moral compulsions of
            the human conscience, those are the things by which we have been
            building up civilization, not by force. And the lasting impression
            that those boys are going to leave is this, that they exercise
            self-control; that they are ready and diligent to make the place
            where they went fitter to live in than they found it; that they
            regarded other people’s rights; that they did not strut and bluster,
            but went quietly, like self-respecting gentlemen, about their
            legitimate work. And the people of <place reg="Vera Cruz, Mexico" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Vera Cruz</place>, who feared the Americans and despised the
            Americans, are going to get a very different taste in their mouths
            about the whole thing when the boys of the Navy and the Army come
            away. Is that not something to be proud of, that you know how to use
            force like men of conscience and like gentlemen, serving your fellow
            men and not trying to overcome them? Like that gallant gentleman who
            has so long borne the heats and perplexities and distresses of the
            situation in <place reg="Vera Cruz, Mexico" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Vera
               Cruz</place>—<person link-pointer-type="person">Admiral Fletcher</person>. I mention him,
            because his service there has been longer and so much of the early
            perplexities fell upon him. I have been in almost daily
            communication with <person link-pointer-type="person">Admiral Fletcher</person>, and I have
            tested his temper. I have tested his discretion. I know that he is a
            man with a touch of statesmanship about him, and he has grown bigger
            in my eye each day as I have read his dispatches, for he has sought
            always to serve the thing he was trying to do in the temper that we
            all recognize and love to believe is typically American.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I challenge you youngsters to go out with these
            conceptions, knowing that you are part of the Government and force
            of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> and that men will judge us by
            you. I am not afraid of the verdict. I can not look in your faces
            and doubt what it will be, but I want you to take these great
            engines of force out onto the seas like adventurers enlisted for the
            elevation of the spirit of the human race. For that is the only
            distinction that <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> has. Other nations have been
            strong, other nations have piled wealth as high as the sky, but they
            have come into disgrace because they used their force and their
            wealth for the oppression of mankind and their own aggrandizement;
            and <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> will not bring glory to herself, but
            disgrace, by following the beaten paths of history. We must strike
            out upon new paths, and we must count upon you gentlemen to be the
            explorers who will carry this spirit and spread this message all
            over the seas and in every port of the civilized world.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">You see, therefore, why I said that when I faced you I
            felt there was a special significance. I am not present on an
            occasion when you are about to scatter on various errands. You are
            all going on the same errand, and I like to feel bound with you in
            one common organization for the glory of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place>. And
            her glory goes deeper than all the tinsel, goes deeper than the
            sound of guns and the clash of sabers; it goes down to the very
            foundation of those things that have made the spirit of men free and
            happy and content.</p>

               Citizens</render>:</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">We are assembled to celebrate the one hundred and
            thirty-eighth anniversary of the birth of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United
            States</place>. I suppose that we can more vividly realize the
            circumstances of that birth standing on this historic spot than it
            would be possible to realize them anywhere else. The Declaration of
            Independence was written in <place reg="Philadelphia, PA" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Philadelphia</place>; it was adopted in this historic building
            by which we stand. I have just had the privilege of sitting in the
            chair of the <personRef reg="John Hancock" link-pointer-type="person">great man who presided
               over the deliberations</personRef> of those who gave the
            declaration to the world. My hand rests at this moment upon the
            table upon which the declaration was signed. We can feel that we are
            almost in the visible and tangible presence of a great historic
            transaction.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Have you ever read the Declaration of Independence or
            attended with close comprehension to the real character of it when
            you have heard it read? If you have, you will know that it is not a
            Fourth of July oration. The Declaration of Independence was a
            document preliminary to war. It was a vital piece of practical
            business, not a piece of rhetoric; and if you will pass beyond those
            preliminary passages which we are accustomed to quote about the
            rights of men and read into the heart of the document you will see
            that it is very express and detailed, that it consists of a series
            of definite specifications concerning actual public business of the
            day. Not the business of our day, for the matter with which it deals
            is past, but the business of that first revolution by which the
            Nation was set up, the business of <date value="1776-99-99">1776</date>. Its general statements, its general declarations can
            not mean anything to us unless we append to it a similar specific
            body of particulars as to what we consider the essential business of
            our own day.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Liberty does not consist, my fellow citizens, in mere
            general declarations of the rights of man. It consists in the
            translation of those declarations into definite action. Therefore,
            standing here where the declaration was adopted, reading its
            businesslike sentences, we ought to ask ourselves what there is in
            it for us. There is nothing in it for us unless we can translate it
            into the terms of our own conditions and of our own lives. We must
            reduce it to what the lawyers call a bill of particulars. It
            contains a bill of particulars, but the bill of particulars of <date value="1776-99-99">1776</date>. If we would keep it alive, we
            must fill it with a bill of particulars of the year <date value="1914-99-99">1914</date>.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The task to which we have constantly to readdress
            ourselves is the task of proving that we are worthy of the men who
            drew this great declaration and know what they would have done in
            our circumstances. Patriotism consists in some very practical
            things—practical in that they belong to the life of every day, that
            they wear no extraordinary distinction about them, that they are
            connected with commonplace duty. The way to be patriotic in
               <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> is not only to love <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place>
            but to love the duty that lies nearest to our hand and know that in
            performing it we are serving our country. There are some gentlemen
            in <place reg="Washington, DC" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Washington</place>, for example, at
            this very moment who are showing themselves very patriotic in a way
            which does not attract wide attention but seems to belong to mere
            everyday obligations. The Members of the House and Senate who stay
            in hot <place reg="Washington, DC" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Washington</place> to maintain a
            quorum of the Houses and transact the all-important business of the
            Nation are doing an act of patriotism. I honor them for it, and I am
            glad to stay there and stick by them until the work is done.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">It is patriotic, also, to learn what the facts of our
            national life are and to face them with candor. I have heard a great
            many facts stated about the present business condition of this
            country, for example—a great many allegations of fact, at any rate,
            but the allegations do not tally with one another. And yet I know
            that truth always matches with truth; and when I find some insisting
            that everything is going wrong and others insisting that everything
            is going right, and when I know from a wide observation of the
            general circumstances of the country taken as a whole that things
            are going extremely well, I wonder what those who are crying out
            that things are wrong are trying to do. Are they trying to serve the
            country, or are they trying to serve something smaller than the
            country? Are they trying to put hope into the hearts of the men who
            work and toil every day, or are they trying to plant discouragement
            and despair in those hearts? And why do they cry that everything is
            wrong and yet do nothing to set it right? If they love
               <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> and anything is wrong amongst us, it is
            their business to put their hand with ours to the task of setting it
            right. When the facts are known and acknowledged, the duty of all
            patriotic men is to accept them in candor and to address themselves
            hopefully and confidently to the common counsel which is necessary
            to act upon them wisely and in universal concert.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I have had some experiences in the last 14 months
            which have not been entirely reassuring. It was universally
            admitted, for example, my fellow citizens, that the banking system
            of this country needed reorganization. We set the best minds that we
            could find to the task of discovering the best method of
            reorganization. But we met with hardly anything but criticism from
            the bankers of the country; we met with hardly anything but
            resistance from the majority of those at least who spoke at all
            concerning the matter. And yet so soon as that act was passed there
            was a universal chorus of applause, and the very men who had opposed
            the measure joined in that applause. If it was wrong the day before
            it was passed, why was it right the day after it was passed? Where
            had been the candor of criticism not only, but the concert of
            counsel which makes legislative action vigorous and safe and
            successful?</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">It is not patriotic to concert measures against one
            another; it is patriotic to concert measures for one another.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">In one sense the Declaration of Independence has lost
            its significance. It has lost its significance as a declaration of
            national independence. Nobody outside of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place>
            believed when it was uttered that we could make good our
            independence; now nobody anywhere would dare to doubt that we are
            independent and can maintain our independence. As a declaration of
            independence, therefore, it is a mere historic document. Our
            independence is a fact so stupendous that it can be measured only by
            the size and energy and variety and wealth and power of one of the
            greatest nations in the world. But it is one thing to be independent
            and it is another thing to know what to do with your independence.
            It is one thing to come to your majority and another thing to know
            what you are going to do with your life and your energies; and one
            of the most serious questions for sober-minded men to address
            themselves to in the United States is this: What are we going to do
            with the influence and power of this great Nation? Are we going to
            play the old rôle of using that power for our aggrandizement and
            material benefit only? You know what that may mean. It may upon
            occasion mean that we shall use it to make the peoples of other
            nations suffer in the way in which we said it was intolerable to
            suffer when we uttered our Declaration of Independence.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The Department of State at <place reg="Washington, DC" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Washington</place> is constantly called upon to back up the
            commercial enterprises and the industrial enterprises of the
               <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> in foreign countries, and it at one
            time went so far in that direction that all its diplomacy came to be
            designated as “dollar diplomacy.” It was called upon to support
            every man who wanted to earn anything anywhere if he was an
            American. But there ought to be a limit to that. There is no man who
            is more interested than I am in carrying the enterprise of American
            business men to every quarter of the globe. I was interested in it
            long before I was suspected of being a politician. I have been
            preaching it year after year as the great thing that lay in the
            future for the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place>, to show her wit and
            skill and enterprise and influence in every country in the world.
            But observe the limit to all that which is laid upon us perhaps more
            than upon any other nation in the world. We set this Nation up, at
            any rate we professed to set it up, to vindicate the rights of men.
            We did not name any differences between one race and another. We did
            not set up any barriers against any particular people. We opened our
            gates to all the world and said, “Let all men who wish to be free
            come to us and they will be welcome.” We said, “This independence of
            ours is not a selfish thing for our own exclusive private use. It is
            for everybody to whom we can find the means of extending it.” We can
            not with that oath taken in our youth, we can not with that great
            ideal set before us when we were a young people and numbered only a
            scant 3,000,000, take upon ourselves, now that we are 100,000,000
            strong, any other conception of duty than we then entertained. If
            American enterprise in foreign countries, particularly in those
            foreign countries which are not strong enough to resist us, takes
            the shape of imposing upon and exploiting the mass of the people of
            that country it ought to be checked and not encouraged. I am willing
            to get anything for an American that money and enterprise can obtain
            except the suppression of the rights of other men. I will not help
            any man buy a power which he ought not to exercise over his fellow
            beings.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">You know, my fellow countrymen, what a big question
            there is in <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Mexico</place>. Eighty-five per cent of the
            Mexican people have never been allowed to have any genuine
            participation in their own Government or to exercise any substantial
            rights with regard to the very land they live upon. All the rights
            that men most desire have been exercised by the other 15 per cent.
            Do you suppose that that circumstance is not sometimes in my
            thought? I know that the American people have a heart that will beat
            just as strong for those millions in <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Mexico</place> as it
            will beat, or has beaten, for any other millions elsewhere in the
            world, and that when once they conceive what is at stake in
               <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Mexico</place> they will know what ought to be done in
               <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Mexico</place>. I hear a great deal said about the loss of
            property in <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Mexico</place> and the loss of the lives of
            foreigners, and I deplore these things with all my heart.
            Undoubtedly, upon the conclusion of the present disturbed conditions
            in <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Mexico</place> those who have been unjustly deprived of
            their property or in any wise unjustly put upon ought to be
            compensated. Men’s individual rights have no doubt been invaded, and
            the invasion of those rights has been attended by many deplorable
            circumstances which ought sometime, in the proper way, to be
            accounted for. But back of it all is the struggle of a people to
            come into its own, and while we look upon the incidents in the
            foreground let us not forget the great tragic reality in the
            background which towers above the whole picture.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">A patriotic American is a man who is not niggardly and
            selfish in the things that he enjoys that make for human liberty and
            the rights of man. He wants to share them with the whole world, and
            he is never so proud of the great flag under which he lives as when
            it comes to mean to other people as well as to himself a symbol of
            hope and liberty. I would be ashamed of this flag if it ever did
            anything outside <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> that we would not permit it
            to do inside of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place>.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The world is becoming more complicated every day, my
            fellow citizens. No man ought to be foolish enough to think that he
            understands it all. And, therefore, I am glad that there are some
            simple things in the world. One of the simple things is principle.
            Honesty is a perfectly simple thing. It is hard for me to believe
            that in most circumstances when a man has a choice of ways he does
            not know which is the right way and which is the wrong way. No man
            who has chosen the wrong way ought even to come into
               <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Independence Square</place>; it is holy ground which he
            ought not to tread upon. He ought not to come where immortal voices
            have uttered the great sentences of such a document as this
            Declaration of Independence upon which rests the liberty of a whole
            nation.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">And so I say that it is patriotic sometimes to prefer
            the honor of the country to its material interest. Would you rather
            be deemed by all the nations of the world incapable of keeping your
            treaty obligations in order that you might have free tolls for
            American ships? The treaty under which we gave up that right may
            have been a mistaken treaty, but there was no mistake about its
            meaning.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">When I have made a promise as a man I try to keep it,
            and I know of no other rule permissible to a nation. The most
            distinguished nation in the world is the nation that can and will
            keep its promises even to its own hurt. And I want to say
            parenthetically that I do not think anybody was hurt. I can not be
            enthusiastic for subsidies to a monopoly, but let those who are
            enthusiastic for subsidies ask themselves whether they prefer
            subsidies to unsullied honor.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The most patriotic man, ladies and gentlemen, is
            sometimes the man who goes in the direction that he thinks right
            even when he sees half the world against him. It is the dictate of
            patriotism to sacrifice yourself if you think that that is the path
            of honor and of duty. Do not blame others if they do not agree with
            you. Do not die with bitterness in your heart because you did not
            convince the rest of the world, but die happy because you believe
            that you tried to serve your country by not selling your soul. Those
            were grim days, the days of <date value="1776-99-99">1776</date>.
            Those gentlemen did not attach their names to the Declaration of
            Independence on this table expecting a holiday on the next day, and
            that <date value="1776-07-04">4th of July</date> was not itself a
            holiday. They attached their signatures to that significant document
            knowing that if they failed it was certain that every one of them
            would hang for the failure. They were committing treason in the
            interest of the liberty of 3,000,000 people in
            <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place>. All the rest of the world was against them
            and smiled with cynical incredulity at the audacious undertaking. Do
            you think that if they could see this great Nation now they would
            regret anything that they then did to draw the gaze of a hostile
            world upon them? Every idea must be started by somebody, and it is a
            lonely thing to start anything. Yet if it is in you, you must start
            it if you have a man’s blood in you and if you love the country that
            you profess to be working for.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I am sometimes very much interested when I see
            gentlemen supposing that popularity is the way to success in
               <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place>. The way to success in this great country,
            with its fair judgments, is to show that you are not afraid of
            anybody except God and his final verdict. If I did not believe that,
            I would not believe in democracy. If I did not believe that, I would
            not believe that people can govern themselves. If I did not believe
            that the moral judgment would be the last judgment, the final
            judgment, in the minds of men as well as the tribunal of God, I
            could not believe in popular government. But I do believe these
            things, and, therefore, I earnestly believe in the democracy not
            only of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> but of every awakened people that
            wishes and intends to govern and control its own affairs.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">It is very inspiring, my friends, to come to this that
            may be called the original fountain of independence and liberty in
               <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> and here drink draughts of patriotic
            feeling which seem to renew the very blood in one’s veins. Down in
               <place reg="Washington, DC" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Washington</place> sometimes when the
            days are hot and the business presses intolerably and there are so
            many things to do that it does not seem possible to do anything in
            the way it ought to be done, it is always possible to lift one’s
            thought above the task of the moment and, as it were, to realize
            that great thing of which we are all parts, the great body of
            American feeling and American principle. No man could do the work
            that has to be done in <place reg="Washington, DC" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Washington</place> if he allowed himself to be separated from that
            body of principle. He must make himself feel that he is a part of
            the people of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place>, that he is trying to
            think not only for them, but with them, and then he can not feel
            lonely. He not only can not feel lonely but he can not feel afraid
            of anything.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">My dream is that as the years go on and the world
            knows more and more of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> it will also drink at
            these fountains of youth and renewal; that it also will turn to
               <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> for those moral inspirations which lie at
            the basis of all freedom; that the world will never fear
               <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> unless it feels that it is engaged in some
            enterprise which is inconsistent with the rights of humanity; and
            that <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> will come into the full light of the day
            when all shall know that she puts human rights above all other
            rights and that her flag is the flag not only of
            <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> but of humanity.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">What other great people has devoted itself to this

            anywhere are fighting for their rights? I do not know that there
            will ever be a declaration of independence and of grievances for
            mankind, but I believe that if any such document is ever drawn it
            will be drawn in the spirit of the American Declaration of
            Independence, and that <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> has lifted high the

         <p rend="noindent" xml:space="preserve"><render as="smallcap" rend="inherit">My Fellow Countrymen</render>:</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I suppose that every thoughtful man in <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> has asked himself, during these last troubled weeks, what influence the European war may exert upon the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place>, and I take the liberty of addressing a few words to you in order to point out that it is entirely within our own choice what its effects upon us will be and to urge very earnestly upon you the sort of speech and conduct which will best safeguard the Nation against distress and disaster.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The effect of the war upon the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> will depend upon what American citizens say and do. Every man who really loves <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> will act and speak in the true spirit of neutrality, which is the spirit of impartiality and fairness and friendliness to all concerned. The spirit of the Nation in this critical matter will be determined largely by what individuals and society and those gathered in public meetings do and say, upon what newspapers and magazines contain, upon what ministers utter in their pulpits, and men proclaim as their opinions on the street.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The people of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> are drawn from many nations, and chiefly from the nations now at war. It is natural and inevitable that there should be the utmost variety of sympathy and desire among them with regard to the issues and circumstances of the conflict. Some will wish one nation, others another, to succeed in the momentous struggle. It will be easy to excite passion and difficult to allay it. Those responsible for exciting it will assume a heavy responsibility, responsibility for no less a thing than that the people of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place>, whose love of their country and whose loyalty to its Government should unite them as Americans all, bound in honor and affection to think first of her and her interests, may be divided in camps of hostile opinion, hot against each other, involved in the war itself in impulse and opinion if not in action.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Such divisions among us would be fatal to our peace of mind and might seriously stand in the way of the proper performance of our duty as the one great nation at peace, the one people holding itself ready to play a part of impartial mediation and speak the counsels of peace and accommodation, not as a partisan, but as a friend.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I venture, therefore, my fellow countrymen, to speak a solemn word of warning to you against that deepest, most subtle, most essential breach of neutrality which may spring out of partisanship, out of passionately taking sides. The <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> must be neutral in fact as well as in name during these days that are to try men’s souls. We must be impartial in thought as well as in action, must put a curb upon our sentiments as well as upon every transaction that might be construed as a preference of one party to the struggle before another.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">My thought is of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place>. I am speaking, I feel sure, the earnest wish and purpose of every thoughtful American that this great country of ours, which is, of course, the first in our thoughts and in our hearts, should show herself in this time of peculiar trial a Nation fit beyond others to exhibit the fine poise of undisturbed judgment, the dignity of self-control, the efficiency of dispassionate action; a Nation that neither sits in judgment upon others nor is disturbed in her own counsels and which keeps herself fit and free to do what is honest and disinterested and truly serviceable for the peace of the world.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Shall we not resolve to put upon ourselves the restraints which will bring to our people the happiness and the great and lasting influence for peace we covet for them?</p>

            <render as="italic" rend="inherit">Gentlemen of the Congress:</render>
         </p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I come to you <word altform="today">to-day</word> to
            discharge a duty which I wish with all my heart I might have been
            spared; but it is a very clear duty, and therefore I perform it
            without hesitation or apology. I come to ask very earnestly that
            additional revenue be provided for the Government.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">During the month of August there was, as compared with
            the corresponding month of last year, a falling off of <currency type="U.S.A">$10,629,538</currency> in the revenues collected
            from customs. A continuation of this decrease in the same proportion
            throughout the current fiscal year would probably mean a loss of
            customs revenues of from sixty to one hundred millions. I need not
            tell you to what this falling off is due. It is due, in chief part,
            not to the reductions recently made in the customs duties, but to
            the great decrease in importations; and that is due to the
            extraordinary extent of the industrial area affected by the present
            war in <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Europe</place>. Conditions have arisen which no man
            foresaw; they affect the whole world of commerce and economic
            production; and they must be faced and dealt with.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">It would be very unwise to postpone dealing with them.
            Delay in such a matter and in the particular circumstances in which
            we now find ourselves as a nation might involve consequences of the
            most embarrassing and deplorable sort, for which I, for one, would
            not care to be responsible. It would be very dangerous in the
            present circumstances to create a moment’s doubt as to the strength
            and sufficiency of the Treasury of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place>,
            its ability to assist, to steady, and sustain the financial
            operations of the country’s business. If the Treasury is known, or
            even thought, to be weak, where will be our peace of mind? The whole
            industrial activity of the country would be chilled and demoralized.
            Just now the peculiarly difficult financial problems of the moment
            are being successfully dealt with, with great self-possession and
            good sense and very sound judgment; but they are only in process of
            being worked out. If the process of solution is to be completed, no
            one must be given reason to doubt the solidity and adequacy of the
            Treasury of the Government which stands behind the whole method by
            which our difficulties are being met and handled.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The Treasury itself could get along for a considerable
            period, no doubt, without immediate resort to new sources of
            taxation. But at what cost to the business of the community?
            Approximately <currency type="U.S.A">$75,000,000</currency>, a large
            part of the present Treasury balance, is now on deposit with
            national banks distributed throughout the country. It is deposited,
            of course, on call. I need not point out to you what the probable
            consequences of inconvenience and distress and confusion would be if
            the diminishing income of the Treasury should make it necessary
            rapidly to withdraw these deposits. And yet without additional
            revenue that plainly might become necessary, and the time when it
            became necessary could not be controlled or determined by the
            convenience of the business of the country. It would have to be
            determined by the operations and necessities of the Treasury itself.
            Such risks are not necessary and ought not to be run. We can not too
            scrupulously or carefully safeguard a financial situation which is
            at best, while war continues in <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Europe</place>, difficult and
            abnormal. Hesitation and delay are the worst forms of bad policy
            under such conditions.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">And we ought not to borrow. We ought to resort to
            taxation, however we may regret the necessity of putting additional
            temporary burdens on our people. To sell bonds would be to make a
            most untimely and unjustifiable demand on the money market;
            untimely, because this is manifestly not the time to withdraw
            working capital from other uses to pay the Government’s bills;
            unjustifiable, because unnecessary. The country is able to pay any
            just and reasonable taxes without distress. And to every other form
            of borrowing, whether for long periods or for short, there is the
            same objection. These are not the circumstances, this is at this
            particular moment and in this particular exigency not the market, to
            borrow large sums of money. What we are seeking is to ease and
            assist every financial transaction, not to add a single additional
            embarrassment to the situation. The people of this country are both
            intelligent and profoundly patriotic. They are ready to meet the
            present conditions in the right way and to support the Government
            with generous self-denial. They know and understand, and will be
            intolerant only of those who dodge responsibility or are not frank
            with them.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The occasion is not of our own making. We had no part
            in making it. But it is here. It affects us as directly and palpably
            almost as if we were participants in the circumstances which gave
            rise to it. We must accept the inevitable with calm judgment and
            unruffled spirits, like men accustomed to deal with the unexpected,
            habituated to take care of themselves, masters of their own affairs
            and their own fortunes. We shall pay the bill, though we did not
            deliberately incur it.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">In order to meet every demand upon the Treasury
            without delay or peradventure and in order to keep the Treasury
            strong, unquestionably strong, and strong throughout the present
            anxieties, I respectfully urge that an additional revenue of
               <currency type="U.S.A">$100,000,000</currency> be raised through
            internal taxes devised in your wisdom to meet the emergency. The
            only suggestion I take the liberty of making is that such sources of
            revenue be chosen as will begin to yield at once and yield with a
            certain and constant flow.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I can not close without expressing the confidence with
            which I approach a Congress, with regard to this or any other
            matter, which has shown so untiring a devotion to public duty, which
            has responded to the needs of the Nation throughout a long season
            despite inevitable fatigue and personal sacrifice, and so large a
            proportion of whose Members have devoted their whole time and energy
            to the business of the country.</p>

         <p rend="noindent" xml:space="preserve">Mr. <render as="smallcap" rend="inherit">President, Gentlemen of
               the American Bar Association</render>:</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I am very deeply gratified by the greeting that your
            president has given me and by your response to it. My only strength
            lies in your confidence.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">We stand now in a peculiar case. Our first thought, I
            suppose, as lawyers, is of international law, of those bonds of
            right and principle which draw the nations together and hold the
            community of the world to some standards of action. We know that we
            see in international law, as it were, the moral processes by which
            law itself came into existence. I know that as a lawyer I have
            myself at times felt that there was no real comparison between the
            law of a nation and the law of nations, because the latter lacked
            the sanction that gave the former strength and validity. And yet, if
            you look into the matter more closely, you will find that the two
            have the same foundations, and that those foundations are more
            evident and conspicuous in our day than they have ever been before.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The opinion of the world is the mistress of the world;
            and the processes of international law are the slow processes by
            which opinion works its will. What impresses me is the constant
            thought that that is the tribunal at the bar of which we all sit. I
            would call your attention, incidentally, to the circumstance that it
            does not observe the ordinary rules of evidence; which has sometimes
            suggested to me that the ordinary rules of evidence had shown some
            signs of growing antique. Everything, rumor included, is heard in
            this court, and the standard of judgment is not so much the
            character of the testimony as the character of the witness. The
            motives are disclosed, the purposes are conjectured, and that
            opinion is finally accepted which seems to be, not the best founded
            in law, perhaps, but the best founded in integrity of character and
            of morals. That is the process which is slowly working its will upon
            the world; and what we should be watchful of is not so much jealous
            interests as sound principles of action. The disinterested course is
            always the biggest course to pursue not only, but it is in the long
            run the most profitable course to pursue. If you can establish your
            character, you can establish your credit.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">What I wanted to suggest to this association, in
            bidding them very hearty welcome to the city, is whether we
            sufficiently apply these same ideas to the body of municipal law
            which we seek to administer. Citations seem to play so much larger a
            rôle now than principle. There was a time when the thoughtful eye of
            the judge rested upon the changes of social circumstances and almost
            palpably saw the law arise out of human life. Have we got to a time
            when the only way to change law is by statute? The changing of law
            by statute seems to me like mending a garment with a patch, whereas
            law should grow by the life that is in it, not by the life that is
            outside of it.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I once said to a lawyer with whom I was discussing
            some question of precedent, and in whose presence I was venturing to
            doubt the rational validity, at any rate, of the particular
            precedents he cited, “After all, isn’t our object justice?” And he
            said, “God forbid! We should be very much confused if we made that
            our standard. Our standard is to find out what the rule has been and
            how the rule that has been applies to the case that is.” I should
            hate to think that the law was based entirely upon “has beens.” I
            should hate to think that the law did not derive its impulse from
            looking forward rather than from looking backward, or, rather, that
            it did not derive its instruction from looking about and seeing what
            the circumstances of man actually are and what the impulses of
            justice necessarily are.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Understand me, gentlemen, I am not venturing in this
            presence to impeach the law. For the present, by the force of
            circumstances, I am in part the embodiment of the law, and it would
            be very awkward to disavow myself. But I do wish to make this
            intimation, that in this time of world change, in this time when we
            are going to find out just how, in what particulars, and to what
            extent the real facts of human life and the real moral judgments of
            mankind prevail, it is worth while looking inside our municipal law
            and seeing whether the judgments of the law are made square with the
            moral judgments of mankind. For I believe that we are custodians,
            not of commands, but of a spirit. We are custodians of the spirit of
            righteousness, of the spirit of equal-handed justice, of the spirit
            of hope which believes in the perfectibility of the law with the
            perfectibility of human life itself.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Public life, like private life, would be very dull and
            dry if it were not for this belief in the essential beauty of the
            human spirit and the belief that the human spirit could be
            translated into action and into ordinance. Not entire. You can not
            go any faster than you can advance the average moral judgments of
            the mass, but you can go at least as fast as that, and you can see
            to it that you do not lag behind the average moral judgments of the
            mass. I have in my life dealt with all sorts and conditions of men,
            and I have found that the flame of moral judgment burned just as
            bright in the man of humble life and limited experience as in the
            scholar and the man of affairs. And I would like his voice always to
            be heard, not as a witness, not as speaking in his own case, but as
            if he were the voice of men in general, in our courts of justice, as
            well as the voice of the lawyers, remembering what the law has been.
            My hope is that, being stirred to the depths by the extraordinary
            circumstances of the time in which we live, we may recover from
            those depths something of a renewal of that vision of the law with
            which men may be supposed to have started out in the old days of the
            oracles, who communed with the intimations of divinity.</p>

               <render as="smallcap" rend="inherit">Porter, Ladies and Gentlemen</render>:</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I feel almost as if I were a truant, being away from
               <place reg="Washington, DC" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Washington</place>
            <word altform="today">to-day</word>, but I thought that perhaps if I
            were absent the Congress would have the more leisure to adjourn. I
            do not ordinarily open my office at <place reg="Washington, DC" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Washington</place> on Saturday. Being a schoolmaster, I am
            accustomed to a Saturday holiday, and I thought I could not better
            spend a holiday than by showing at least something of the true
            direction of my affections; for by long association with the men who
            have worked for this organization I can say that it has enlisted my
            deep affection.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I am interested in it for various reasons. First of
            all, because it is an association of young men. I have had a good
            deal to do with young men in my time, and I have formed an
            impression of them which I believe to be contrary to the general
            impression. They are generally thought to be arch radicals. As a
            matter of fact, they are the most conservative people I have ever
            dealt with. Go to a college community and try to change the least
            custom of that little world and find how the conservatives will rush
            at you. Moreover, young men are embarrassed by having inherited
            their fathers’ opinions. I have often said that the use of a
            university is to make young gentlemen as unlike their fathers as
            possible. I do not say that with the least disrespect for the
            fathers; but every man who is old enough to have a son in college is
            old enough to have become very seriously immersed in some particular
            business and is almost certain to have caught the point of view of
            that particular business. And it is very useful to his son to be
            taken out of that narrow circle, conducted to some high place where
            he may see the general map of the world and of the interests of
            mankind, and there shown how big the world is and how much of it his
            father may happen to have forgotten. It would be worth while for
            men, middle-aged and old, to detach themselves more frequently from
            the things that command their daily attention and to think of the
            sweeping tides of humanity.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Therefore I am interested in this association, because
            it is intended to bring young men together before any crust has
            formed over them, before they have been hardened to any particular
            occupation, before they have caught an inveterate point of view;
            while they still have a searchlight that they can swing and see what
            it reveals of all the circumstances of the hidden world.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I am the more interested in it because it is an
            association of young men who are Christians. I wonder if we attach
            sufficient importance to Christianity as a mere instrumentality in
            the life of mankind. For one, I am not fond of thinking of
            Christianity as the means of saving <render as="italic" rend="inherit">individual</render> souls. I have always been very impatient of
            processes and institutions which said that their purpose was to put
            every man in the way of developing his character. My advice is: Do
            not think about your character. If you will think about what you
            ought to do for other people, your character will take care of
            itself. Character is a by-product, and any man who devotes himself
            to its cultivation in his own case will become a selfish prig. The
            only way your powers can become great is by exerting them outside
            the circle of your own narrow, special, selfish interests. And that
            is the reason of Christianity. <person reg="Jesus" link-pointer-type="person">Christ</person>
            came into the world to save others, not to save himself; and no man
            is a true Christian who does not think constantly of how he can lift
            his brother, how he can assist his friend, how he can enlighten
            mankind, how he can make virtue the rule of conduct in the circle in
            which he lives. An association merely of young men might be an
            association that had its energies put forth in every direction, but
            an association of Christian young men is an association meant to put
            its shoulders under the world and lift it, so that other men may
            feel that they have companions in bearing the weight and heat of the
            day; that other men may know that there are those who care for them,
            who would go into places of difficulty and danger to rescue them,
            who regard themselves as their brother’s keeper.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">And, then, I am glad that it is an association. Every
            word of its title means an element of strength. Young men are
            strong. Christian young men are the strongest kind of young men, and
            when they associate themselves together they have the incomparable
            strength of organization. The Young Men’s Christian Association once
            excited, perhaps it is not too much to say, the hostility of the
            organized churches of the Christian world, because the movement
            looked as if it were so nonsectarian, as if it were so outside the
            ecclesiastical field, that perhaps it was an effort to draw young
            men away from the churches and to substitute this organization for
            the great bodies of Christian people who joined themselves in the
            Christian denominations. But after a while it appeared that it was a
            great instrumentality that belonged to all the churches; that it was
            a common instrument for sending the light of Christianity out into
            the world in its most practical form, drawing young men who were
            strangers into places where they could have companionship that
            stimulated them and suggestions that kept them straight and
            occupations that amused them without vicious practice; and then, by
            surrounding themselves with an atmosphere of purity and of
            simplicity of life, catch something of a glimpse of the great ideal
            which <person reg="Jesus" link-pointer-type="person">Christ</person> lifted when He was
            elevated upon the cross.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I remember hearing a very wise man say once, a man
            grown old in the service of a great church, that he had never taught
            his son religion dogmatically at any time; that he and the boy’s
            mother had agreed that if the atmosphere of that home did not make a
            Christian of the boy, nothing that they could say would make a
            Christian of him. They knew that Christianity was catching, and if
            they did not have it, it would not be communicated. If they did have
            it, it would penetrate while the boy slept, almost; while he was
            unconscious of the sweet influences that were about him, while he
            reckoned nothing of instruction, but merely breathed into his lungs
            the wholesome air of a Christian home. That is the principle of the
            Young Men’s Christion Association—to make a place where the
            atmosphere makes great ideals contagious. That is the reason that I
            said, though I had forgotten that I said it, what is quoted on the
            outer page of the program—that you can test a modern community by
            the degree of its interest in its Young Men’s Christian Association.
            You can test whether it knows what road it wants to travel or not.
            You can test whether it is deeply interested in the spiritual and
            essential prosperity of its rising generation. I know of no test
            that can be more conclusively put to a community than that.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I want to suggest to the young men of this association
            that it is the duty of young men not only to combine for the things
            that are good, but to combine in a militant spirit. There is a fine
            passage in one of <person reg="John Milton" link-pointer-type="person">Milton’s</person> prose
            writings which I am sorry to say I can not quote, but the meaning of
            which I can give you, and it is worth hearing. He says that he has
            no patience with a cloistered virtue that does not go out and seek
            its adversary. Ah, how tired I am of the men who are merely on the
            defensive, who hedge themselves in, who perhaps enlarge the hedge
            enough to include their little family circle and ward off all the
            evil influences of the world from that loved and hallowed group. How
            tired I am of the men whose virtue is selfish because it is merely
            self-protective! And how much I wish that men by the hundred
            thousand might volunteer to go out and seek an adversary and subdue
            him!</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I have had the fortune to take part in affairs of a
            considerable variety of sorts, and I have tried to hate as few
            persons as possible, but there is an exquisite combination of
            contempt and hate that I have for a particular kind of person, and
            that is the moral coward. I wish we could give all our cowards a
            perpetual vacation. Let them go off and sit on the side lines and
            see us play the game; and put them off the field if they interfere
            with the game. They do nothing but harm, and they do it by that most
            subtle and fatal thing of all, that of taking the momentum and the
            spirit and the forward dash out of things. A man who is virtuous and
            a coward has no marketable virtue about him. The virtue, I repeat,
            which is merely self-defensive is not serviceable even, I suspect,
            to himself. For how a man can swallow and not taste bad when he is a
            coward and thinking only of himself I can not imagine.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Be militant! Be an organization that is going to do
            things! If you can find older men who will give you countenance and
            acceptable leadership, follow them; but if you can not, organize
            separately and dispense with them. There are only two sorts of men
            worth associating with when something is to be done. Those are young
            men and men who never grow old. Now, if you find men who have grown
            old, about whom the crust has hardened, whose hinges are stiff,
            whose minds always have their eye over the shoulder thinking of
            things as they <render as="italic" rend="inherit">were</render> done, do not have
            anything to do with them. It would not be Christian to exclude them
            from your organization, but merely use them to pad the roll. If you
            can find older men who will lead you acceptably and keep you in
            countenance, I am bound as an older man to advise you to follow
            them. But suit yourselves. Do not follow people that stand still.
            Just remind them that this is not a statical proposition; it is a
            movement, and if they can not get a move on them they are not
            serviceable.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Life, gentlemen—the life of society, the life of the
            world—has constantly to be fed from the bottom. It has to be fed by
            those great sources of strength which are constantly rising in new
            generations. Red blood has to be pumped into it. New fiber has to be
            supplied. That is the reason I have always said that I believed in
            popular institutions. If you can guess beforehand whom your rulers
            are going to be, you can guess with a very great certainty that most
            of them will not be fit to rule. The beauty of popular institutions
            is that you do not know where the man is going to come from, and you
            do not care so he is the right man. You do not know whether he will
            come from the avenue or from the alley. You do not know whether he
            will come from the city or the farm. You do not know whether you
            will ever have heard that name before or not. Therefore you do not
            limit at any point your supply of new strength. You do not say it
            has got to come through the blood of a particular family or through
            the processes of a particular training, or by anything except the
            native impulse and genius of the man himself. The humblest hovel,
            therefore, may produce you your greatest man. A very humble hovel
            did produce you one of your greatest men. That is the process of
            life, this constant surging up of the new strength of unnamed,
            unrecognized, uncatalogued men who are just getting into the
            running, who are just coming up from the masses of the unrecognized
            multitude. You do not know when you will see above the level masses
            of the crowd some great stature lifted head and shoulders above the
            rest, shouldering its way, not violently but gently, to the front
            and saying, “Here am I; follow me.” And his voice will be your
            voice, his thought will be your thought, and you will follow him as
            if you were following the best things in yourselves.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">When I think of an association of Christian young men
            I wonder that it has not already turned the world upside down. I
            wonder, not that it has done so much, for it has done a great deal,
            but that it has done so little; and I can only conjecture that it
            does not realize its own strength. I can only imagine that it has
            not yet got its pace. I wish I could believe, and I do believe, that
            at 70 it is just reaching its majority, and that from this time on a
            dream greater even than <person link-pointer-type="person">George Williams</person> ever
            dreamed will be realized in the great accumulating momentum of
            Christian men throughout the world. For, gentlemen, this is an age
            in which the principles of men who utter public opinion dominate the
            world. It makes no difference what is done for the time being. After
            the struggle is over the jury will sit, and nobody can corrupt that
            jury.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">At one time I tried to write history. I did not know
            enough to write it, but I knew from experience how hard it was to
            find an historian out, and I trusted I would not be found out. I
            used to have this comfortable thought as I saw men struggling in the
            public arena. I used to think to myself, “This is all very well and
            very interesting. You probably assess yourself in such and such a
            way. Those who are your partisans assess you thus and so. Those who
            are your opponents urge a different verdict. But it does not make
            very much difference, because after you are dead and gone some quiet
            historian will sit in a secluded room and tell mankind for the rest
            of time just what to think about you, and his verdict, not the
            verdict of your partisans and not the verdict of your opponents,
            will be the verdict of posterity.” I say that I used to say that to
            myself. It very largely was not so. And yet it was true in this
            sense: If the historian really speaks the judgment of the succeeding
            generation, then he really speaks the judgment also of the
            generations that succeed it, and his assessment, made without the
            passion of the time, made without partisan feeling in the matter—in
            other circumstances, when the air is cool—is the judgment of mankind
            upon your actions.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Now, is it not very important that we who shall
            constitute a portion of the jury should get our best judgments to
            work and base them upon Christian forbearance and Christian
            principles, upon the idea that it is impossible by sophistication to
            establish that a thing that is wrong is right? And yet, while we are
            going to judge with the absolute standard of righteousness, we are
            going to judge with Christian feeling, being men of a like sort
            ourselves, suffering the same temptations, having the same
            weaknesses, knowing the same passions; and while we do not condemn,
            we are going to seek to say and to live the truth. What I am hoping
            for is that these 70 years have just been a running start, and that
            now there will be a great rush of Christian principle upon the
            strongholds of evil and of wrong in the world. Those strongholds are
            not as strong as they look. Almost every vicious man is afraid of
            society, and if you once open the door where he is, he will run. All
            you have to do is to fight, not with cannon but with light.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">May I illustrate it in this way? The Government of the
               <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> has just succeeded in concluding a
            large number of treaties with the leading nations of the world, the
            sum and substance of which is this, that whenever any trouble arises
            the light shall shine on it for a year before anything is done; and
            my prediction is that after the light has shone on it for a year it
            will not be necessary to do anything; that after we know what
            happened, then we will know who was right and who was wrong. I
            believe that light is the greatest sanitary influence in the world.
            That, I suppose, is scientific commonplace, because if you want to
            make a place wholesome the best instrument you can use is the sun;
            to let his rays in, let him search out all the miasma that may lurk
            there. So with moral light: It is the most wholesome and rectifying,
            as well as the most revealing, thing in the world, provided it be
            genuine moral light; not the light of inquisitiveness, not the light
            of the man who likes to turn up ugly things, not the light of the
            man who disturbs what is corrupt for the mere sake of the sensation
            that he creates by disturbing it, but the moral light, the light of
            the man who discloses it in order that all the sweet influences of
            the world may go in and make it better.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">That, in my judgment, is what the Young Men’s
            Christian Association can do. It can point out to its members the
            things that are wrong. It can guide the feet of those who are going
            astray; and when its members have realized the power of the
            Christian principle, then they will not be men if they do not unite
            to see that the rest of the world experiences the same emancipation
            and reaches the same happiness of release.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I believe in the Young Men’s Christian Association
            because I believe in the progress of moral ideas in the world; and I
            do not know that I am sure of anything else. When you are after
            something and have formulated it and have done the very best thing
            you know how to do you have got to be sure for the time being that
            that is the thing to do. But you are a fool if in the back of your
            head you do not know it is possible that you are mistaken. All that
            you can claim is that that is the thing as you see it now and that
            you can not stand still; that you must push forward the things that
            are right. It may turn out that you made mistakes, but what you do
            know is your direction, and you are sure you are moving in that way.
            I was once a college reformer, until discouraged, and I remember a
            classmate of mine saying, “Why, man, can’t you let anything alone?”
            I said, “I let everything alone that you can show me is not itself
            moving in the wrong direction, but I am not going to let those
            things alone that I see are going downhill”; and I borrowed this
            illustration from an ingenious writer. He says, “If you have a post
            that is painted white and want to keep it white, you can not let it
            alone; and if anybody says to you, ‘Why don’t you let that post
            alone,’ you will say, ‘Because I want it to stay white, and
            therefore I have got to paint it at least every second year.’” There
            isn’t anything in this world that will not change if you absolutely
            let it alone, and therefore you have constantly to be attending to
            it to see that it is being taken care of in the right way and that,
            if it is part of the motive force of the world, it is moving in the
            right direction.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">That means that eternal vigilance is the price, not
            only of liberty, but of a great many other things. It is the price
            of everything that is good. It is the price of one’s own soul. It is
            the price of the souls of the people you love; and when it comes
            down to the final reckoning you have a standard that is immutable.
            What shall a man give in exchange for his own soul? Will he sell
            that? Will he consent to see another man sell his soul? Will he
            consent to see the conditions of his community such that men’s souls
            are debauched and trodden underfoot in the mire? What shall he give
            in exchange for his own soul, or any other man’s soul? And since the
            world, the world of affairs, the world of society, is nothing less
            and nothing more than all of us put together, it is a great
            enterprise for the salvation of the soul in this world as well as in
            the next. There is a text in Scripture that has always interested me
            profoundly. It says godliness is profitable in this life as well as
            in the life that is to come; and if you do not start it in this
            life, it will not reach the life that is to come. Your measurements,
            your directions, your whole momentum, have to be established before
            you reach the next world. This world is intended as the place in
            which we shall show that we know how to grow in the stature of
            manliness and of righteousness.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I have come here to bid Godspeed to the great work of
            the Young Men’s Christian Association. I love to think of the
            gathering force of such things as this in the generations to come.
            If a man had to measure the accomplishments of society, the progress
            of reform, the speed of the world’s betterment, by the few little
            things that happened in his own life, by the trifling things that he
            can contribute to accomplish, he would indeed feel that the cost was
            much greater than the result. But no man can look at the past of the
            history of this world without seeing a vision of the future of the
            history of this world; and when you think of the accumulated moral
            forces that have made one age better than another age in the
            progress of mankind, then you can open your eyes to the vision. You
            can see that age by age, though with a blind struggle in the dust of
            the road, though often mistaking the path and losing its way in the
            mire, mankind is yet—sometimes with bloody hands and battered
            knees—nevertheless struggling step after step up the slow stages to
            the day when he shall live in the full light which shines upon the
            uplands, where all the light that illumines mankind shines direct
            from the face of God.</p>

         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The session upon which you are now entering will be
            the closing session of the Sixty-third Congress, a Congress, I
            venture to say, which will long be remembered for the great body of
            thoughtful and constructive work which it has done, in loyal
            response to the thought and needs of the country. I should like in
            this address to review the notable record and try to make adequate
            assessment of it; but no doubt we stand too near the work that has
            been done and are ourselves too much part of it to play the part of
            historians toward it.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Our program of legislation with regard to the
            regulation of business is now virtually complete. It has been put
            forth, as we intended, as a whole, and leaves no conjecture as to
            what is to follow. The road at last lies clear and firm before
            business. It is a road which it can travel without fear or
            embarassment. It is the road to ungrudged, unclouded success. In it
            every honest man, every man who believes that the public interest is
            part of his own interest, may walk with perfect confidence.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Moreover, our thoughts are now more of the future than
            of the past. While we have worked at our tasks of peace the
            circumstances of the whole age have been altered by war. What we
            have done for our own land and our own people we did with the best
            that was in us, whether of character or of intelligence, with sober
            enthusiasm and a confidence in the principles upon which we were
            acting which sustained us at every step of the difficult
            undertaking; but it is done. It has passed from our hands. It is now
            an established part of the legislation of the country. Its
            usefulness, its effects will disclose themselves in experience. What
            chiefly strikes us now, as we look about us during these closing
            days of a year which will be forever memorable in the history of the
            world, is that we face new tasks, have been facing them these six
            months, must face them in the months to come,—face them without
            partisan feeling, like men who have forgotten everything but a
            common duty and the fact that we are representatives of a great
            people whose thought is not of us but of what <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place>
            owes to herself and to all mankind in such circumstances as these
            upon which we look amazed and anxious.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">War has interrupted the means of trade not only but
            also the processes of production. In <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Europe</place> it is
            destroying men and resources wholesale and upon a scale
            unprecedented and appalling. There is reason to fear that the time
            is near, if it be not already at hand, when several of the countries
            of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Europe</place> will find it difficult to do for their
            people what they have hitherto been always easily able to do,—many
            essential and fundamental things. At any rate, they will need our
            help and our manifold services as they have never needed them
            before; and we should be ready, more fit and ready than we have ever
            been.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">It is of equal consequence that the nations whom
               <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Europe</place> has usually supplied with innumerable
            articles of manufacture and commerce of which they are in constant
            need and without which their economic development halts and stands
            still can now get only a small part of what they formerly imported
            and eagerly look to us to supply their all but empty markets. This
            is particularly true of our own neighbors, the States, great and
            small, of Central and South America. Their lines of trade have
            hitherto run chiefly athwart the seas, not to our ports but to the
            ports of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Great Britain</place> and of the older continent of
               <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Europe</place>. I do not stop to inquire why, or to make
            any comment on probable causes. What interests us just now is not
            the explanation but the fact, and our duty and opportunity in the
            presence of it. Here are markets which we must supply, and we must
            find the means of action. The <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place>, this
            great people for whom we speak and act, should be ready, as never
            before, to serve itself and to serve mankind; ready with its
            resources, its energies, its forces of production, and its means of
            distribution.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">It is a very practical matter, a matter of ways and
            means. We have the resources, but are we fully ready to use them?
            And, if we can make ready what we have, have we the means at hand to
            distribute it? We are not fully ready; neither have we the means of
            distribution. We are willing, but we are not fully able. We have the
            wish to serve and to serve greatly, generously; but we are not
            prepared as we should be. We are not ready to mobilize our resources
            at once. We are not prepared to use them immediately and at their
            best, without delay and without waste.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">To speak plainly, we have grossly erred in the way in
            which we have stunted and hindered the development of our merchant
            marine. And now, when we need ships, we have not got them. We have
            year after year debated, without end or conclusion, the best policy
            to pursue with regard to the use of the ores and forests and water
            powers of our national domain in the rich States of the West, when
            we should have acted; and they are still locked up. The key is still
            turned upon them, the door shut fast at which thousands of vigorous
            men, full of initiative, knock clamorously for admittance. The water
            power of our navigable streams outside the national domain also,
            even in the eastern States, where we have worked and planned for
            generations, is still not used as it might be, because we will and
            we won’t; because the laws we have made do not intelligently balance
            encouragement against restraint. We withhold by regulation.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I have come to ask you to remedy and correct these
            mistakes and omissions, even at this short session of a Congress
            which would certainly seem to have done all the work that could
            reasonably be expected of it. The time and the circumstances are
            extraordinary, and so must our efforts be also.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Fortunately, two great measures, finely conceived, the
            one to unlock, with proper safeguards, the resources of the national
            domain, the other to encourage the use of the navigable waters
            outside that domain for the generation of power, have already passed
            the House of Representatives and are ready for immediate
            consideration and action by the Senate. With the deepest earnestness
            I urge their prompt passage. In them both we turn our backs upon
            hesitation and makeshift and formulate a <sic corr="genuine">geuine</sic> policy of use and conservation, in the best sense of
            those words. We owe the one measure not only to the people of that
            great <sic corr="western">wester</sic> country for whose free and
            systematic development, as it seems to me, our legislation has done
            so little, but also to the people of the Nation as a whole; and we
            as clearly owe the other in fulfillment of our repeated promises
            that the water power of the country should in fact as well as in
            name be put at the disposal of great industries which can make
            economical and profitable use of it, the rights of the public being
            adequately guarded the while, and monopoly in the use prevented. To
            have begun such measures and not completed them would indeed mar the
            record of this great Congress very seriously. I hope and confidently
            believe that they will be completed.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">And there is another great piece of legislation which
            awaits and should receive the sanction of the Senate: I mean the
            bill which gives a larger measure of self-government to the people
            of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Philippines</place>. How better, in this time of
            anxious questioning and perplexed policy, could we show our
            confidence in the principles of liberty, as the source as well as
            the expression of life, how better could we demonstrate our own
            self-possession and steadfastness in the courses of justice and
            disinterestedness than by thus going calmly forward to fulfill our
            promises to a dependent people, who will now look more anxiously
            than ever to see whether we have indeed the liberality, the
            unselfishness, the courage, the faith we have boasted and professed.
            I can not believe that the Senate will let this great measure of
            constructive justice await the action of another Congress. Its
            passage would nobly crown the record of these two years of memorable
            labor.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">But I think that you will agree with me that this does
            not complete the toll of our duty. How are we to carry our goods to
            the empty markets of which I have spoken if we have not the ships?
            How are we to build up a great trade if we have not the certain and
            constant means of transportation upon which all profitable and
            useful commerce depends? And how are we to get the ships if we wait
            for the trade to develop without them? To correct the many mistakes
            by which we have discouraged and all but destroyed the merchant
            marine of the country, to retrace the steps by which we have, it
            seems almost deliberately, withdrawn our flag from the seas, except
            where, here and there, a ship of war is bidden carry it or some
            wandering yacht displays it, would take a long time and involve many
            detailed items of legislation, and the trade which we ought
            immediately to handle would disappear or find other channels while
            we debated the items.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The case is not unlike that which confronted us when
            our own continent was to be opened up to settlement and industry,
            and we needed long lines of railway, extended means of
            transportation prepared beforehand, if development was not to lag
            intolerably and wait interminably. We lavishly subsidized the
            building of transcontinental railroads. We look back upon that with
            regret now, because the subsidies led to many scandals of which we
            are ashamed; but we know that the railroads had to be built, and if
            we had it to do over again we should of course build them, but in
            another way. Therefore I propose another way of <sic corr="providing">providings</sic> the means of transportation,
            which must precede, not tardily follow, the development of our trade
            with our neighbor states of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place>. It may seem a
            reversal of the natural order of things, but it is true, that the
            routes of trade must be actually opened—by many ships and regular
            sailings and moderate charges—before streams of merchandise will
            flow freely and profitably through them.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Hence the pending shipping bill, discussed at the last
            session but as yet passed by neither House. In my judgment such
            legislation is imperatively needed and can not wisely be postponed.
            The Government must open these gates of trade, and open them wide;
            open them before it is altogether profitable to open them, or
            altogether reasonable to ask private capital to open them at a
            venture. It is not a question of the Government monopolizing the
            field. It should take action to make it certain that transportation
            at reasonable rates will be promptly provided, even where the
            carriage is not at first profitable; and then, when the carriage has
            become sufficiently profitable to attract and engage private
            capital, and engage it in abundance, the Government ought to
            withdraw. I very earnestly hope that the Congress will be of this
            opinion, and that both Houses will adopt this exceedingly important
            bill.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The great subject of rural credits still remains to be
            dealt with, and it is a matter of deep regret that the difficulties
            of the subject have seemed to render it impossible to complete a
            bill for passage at this session. But it can not be perfected yet,
            and therefore there are no other constructive measures the necessity
            for which I will at this time call your attention to; but I would be
            negligent of a very manifest duty were I not to call the attention
            of the Senate to the fact that the proposed convention for safety at
            sea awaits its confirmation and that the limit fixed in the
            convention itself for its acceptance is the last day of the present
            month. The conference in which this convention originated was called
            by the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place>; the representatives of the
               <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> played a very influential part
            indeed in framing the provisions of the proposed convention; and
            those provisions are in themselves for the most part admirable. It
            would hardly be consistent with the part we have played in the whole
            matter to let it drop and go by the board as if forgotten and
            neglected. It was ratified in May last by the German Government and
            in August by the Parliament of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Great Britain</place>. It
            marks a most hopeful and decided advance in international
            civilization. We should show our earnest good faith in a great
            matter by adding our own acceptance of it.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">There is another matter of which I must make special
            mention, if I am to discharge my conscience, lest it should escape
            your attention. It may seem a very small thing. It affects only a
            single item of appropriation. But many human lives and many great
            enterprises hang upon it. It is the matter of making adequate
            provision for the survey and charting of our coasts. It is
            immediately pressing and exigent in connection with the immense
            coast line of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Alaska</place>, a coast line greater than that
            of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> themselves, though it is also
            very important indeed with regard to the older coasts of the
            continent. We can not use our great Alaskan domain, ships will not
            ply thither, if those coasts and their many hidden dangers are not
            thoroughly surveyed and charted. The work is incomplete at almost
            every point. Ships and lives have been lost in threading what were
            supposed to be well-known main channels. We have not provided
            adequate vessels or adequate machinery for the survey and charting.
            We have used old vessels that were not big enough or strong enough
            and which were so nearly unseaworthy that our inspectors would not
            have allowed private owners to send them to sea. This is a matter
            which, as I have said, seems small, but is in reality very great.
            Its importance has only to be looked into to be appreciated.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Before I close may I say a few words upon two topics,
            much discussed out of doors, upon which it is highly important that
            our judgments should be clear, definite, and steadfast?</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">One of these is economy in government expenditures.
            The duty of economy is not debatable. It is manifest and imperative.
            In the appropriations we pass we are spending the money of the great
            people whose servants we are,—not our own. We are trustees and
            responsible stewards in the spending. The only thing debatable and
            upon which we should be careful to make our thought and purpose
            clear is the kind of economy demanded of us. I assert with the
            greatest confidence that the people of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United
            States</place> are not jealous of the amount their Government costs
            if they are sure that they get what they need and desire for the
            outlay, that the money is being spent for objects of which they
            approve, and that it is being applied with good business sense and
            management.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Governments grow, piecemeal, both in their tasks and
            in the means by which those tasks are to be performed, and very few
            Governments are organized, I venture to say, as wise and experienced
            business men would organize them if they had a clean sheet of paper
            to write upon. Certainly the Government of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United
            States</place> is not. I think that it is generally agreed that
            there should be a systematic reorganization and reassembling of its
            parts so as to secure greater efficiency and effect considerable
            savings in expense. But the amount of money saved in that way would,
            I believe, though no doubt considerable in itself, running, it may
            be, into the millions, be relatively small,—small, I mean, in
            proportion to the total necessary outlays of the Government. It
            would be thoroughly worth effecting, as every saving would, great or
            small. Our duty is not altered by the scale of the saving. But my
            point is that the people of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> do not
            wish to curtail the activities of this Government; they wish,
            rather, to enlarge them; and with every enlargement, with the mere
            growth, indeed, of the country itself, there must come, of course,
            the inevitable increase of expense. The sort of economy we ought to
            practice may be effected, and ought to be effected, by a careful
            study and assessment of the tasks to be performed; and the money
            spent ought to be made to yield the best possible returns in
            efficiency and achievement. And, like good stewards, we should so
            account for every dollar of our appropriations as to make it
            perfectly evident what it was spent for and in what way it was
            spent.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">It is not expenditure but extravagance that we should
            fear being criticized for; not paying for the legitimate enterprises
            and undertakings of a great Government whose people command what it
            should do, but adding what will benefit only a few or pouring money
            out for what need not have been undertaken at all or might have been
            postponed or better and more economically conceived and carried out.
            The Nation is not niggardly; it is very generous. It will chide us
            only if we forget for whom we pay money out and whose money it is we
            pay. These are large and general standards, but they are not very
            difficult of application to particular cases.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The other topic I shall take leave to mention goes
            deeper into the principles of our national life and policy. It is
            the subject of national defense.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">It can not be discussed without first answering some
            very searching questions. It is said in some quarters that we are
            not prepared for war. What is meant by being prepared? Is it meant
            that we are not ready upon brief notice to put a nation in the
            field, a nation of men trained to arms? Of course we are not ready
            to do that; and we shall never be in time of peace so long as we
            retain our present political principles and institutions. And what
            is it that it is suggested we should be prepared to do? To defend
            ourselves against attack? We have always found means to do that, and
            shall find them whenever it is necessary without calling our people
            away from their necessary tasks to render compulsory military
            service in times of peace.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Allow me to speak with great plainness and directness
            upon this great matter and to avow my convictions with deep
            earnestness. I have tried to know what <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> is,
            what her people think, what they are, what they most cherish and
            hold dear. I hope that some of their finer passions are in my own
            heart,—some of the great conceptions and desires which gave birth to
            this Government and which have made the voice of this people a voice
            of peace and hope and liberty among the peoples of the world, and
            that, speaking my own thoughts, I shall, at least in part, speak
            theirs also, however faintly and inadequately, upon this vital
            matter.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">We are at peace with all the world. No one who speaks
            counsel based on fact or drawn from a just and candid interpretation
            of realities can say that there is reason to fear that from any
            quarter our independence or the integrity of our territory is
            threatened. Dread of the power of any other nation we are incapable
            of. We are not jealous of rivalry in the fields of commerce or of
            any other peaceful achievement. We mean to live our own lives as we
            will; but we mean also to let live. We are, indeed, a true friend to
            all the nations of the world, because we threaten none, covet the
            possessions of none, desire the overthrow of none. Our friendship
            can be accepted and is accepted without reservation, because it is
            offered in a spirit and for a purpose which no one need ever
            question or suspect. Therein lies our greatness. We are the
            champions of peace and of concord. And we should be very jealous of
            this distinction which we have sought to earn. Just now we should be
            particularly jealous of it, because it is our dearest present hope
            that this character and reputation may presently, in God’s
            providence, bring us an opportunity such as has seldom been
            vouchsafed any nation, the opportunity to counsel and obtain peace
            in the world and reconciliation and a healing settlement of many a
            matter that has cooled and interrupted the friendship of nations.
            This is the time above all others when we should wish and resolve to
            keep our strength by self-possession, our influence by preserving
            our ancient principles of action.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">From the first we have had a clear and settled policy
            with regard to military establishments. We never have had, and while
            we retain our present principles and ideals we never shall have, a
            large standing army. If asked, Are you ready to defend yourselves?
            we reply, Most assuredly, to the utmost; and yet we shall not turn
               <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> into a military camp. We will not ask our
            young men to spend the best years of their lives making soldiers of
            themselves. There is another sort of energy in us. It will know how
            to declare itself and make itself effective should occasion arise.
            And especially when half the world is on fire we shall be careful to
            make our moral insurance against the spread of the conflagration
            very definite and certain and adequate indeed.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Let us remind ourselves, therefore, of the only thing
            we can do or will do. We must depend in every time of national
            peril, in the future as in the past, not upon a standing army, nor
            yet upon a reserve army, but upon a citizenry trained and accustomed
            to arms. It will be right enough, right American policy, based upon
            our accustomed principles and practices, to provide a system by
            which every citizen who will volunteer for the training may be made
            familiar with the use of modern arms, the rudiments of drill and
            maneuver, and the maintenance and sanitation of camps. We should
            encourage such training and make it a means of discipline which our
            young men will <sic corr="learn">lean</sic> to value. It is right
            that we should provide it not only, but that we should make it as
            attractive as possible, and so induce our young men to undergo it at
            such times as they can command a little freedom and can seek the
            physical development they need, for mere health’s sake, if for
            nothing more. Every means by which such things can be stimulated is
            legitimate, and such a method smacks of true American ideas. It is
            right, too, that the National Guard of the States should be
            developed and strengthened by every means which is not inconsistent
            with our obligations to our own people or with the established
            policy of our Government. And this, also, not because the time or
            occasion specially calls for such measures, but because it should be
            our constant policy to make these provisions for our national peace
            and safety.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">More than this carries with it a reversal of the whole
            history and character of our polity. More than this, proposed at
            this time, permit me to say, would mean merely that we had lost our
            self-possession, that we had been thrown off our balance by a war
            with which we have nothing to do, whose causes can not touch us,
            whose very existence affords us opportunities of friendship and
            disinterested service which should make us ashamed of any thought of
            hostility or fearful preparation for trouble. This is assuredly the
            opportunity for which a people and a government like ours were
            raised up, the opportunity not only to speak but actually to embody
            and exemplify the counsels of peace and amity and the lasting
            concord which is based on justice and fair and generous dealing.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">A powerful navy we have always regarded as our proper
            and natural means of defense; and it has always been of defense that
            we have thought, never of aggression or of conquest. But who shall
            tell us now what sort of a navy to build? We shall take leave to be
            strong upon the seas, in the future as in the past; and there will
            be no thought of offense or of provocation in that. Our ships are
            our natural bulwarks. When will the experts tell us just what kind
            we should construct—and when will they be right for ten years
            together, if the relative efficiency of craft of different kinds and
            uses continues to change as we have seen it change under our very
            eyes in these last few months?</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">But I turn away from the subject. It is not new. There
            is no new need to discuss it. We shall not alter our attitude toward
            it because some amongst us are nervous and excited. We shall easily
            and sensibly agree upon a policy of defense. The question has not
            changed its aspect because the times are not normal. Our policy will
            not be for an occasion. It will be conceived as a permanent and
            settled thing, which we will pursue at all seasons, without haste
            and after a fashion perfectly consistent with the peace of the
            world, the abiding friendship of states, and the unhampered freedom
            of all with whom we deal. Let there be no misconception. The country
            has been misinformed. We have not been negligent of national
            defense. We are not unmindful of the great responsibility resting
            upon us. We shall learn and profit by the lesson of every experience
            and every new circumstance; and what is needed will be adequately
            done.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I close, as I began, by reminding you of the great
            tasks and duties of peace which challenge our best powers and invite
            us to build what will last, the tasks to which we can address
            ourselves now and at all times with free-hearted zest and with all
            the finest gifts of constructive wisdom we possess. To develop our
            life and our resources; to supply our own people, and the people of
            the world as their need arises, from the abundant plenty of our
            fields and our marts of trade; to enrich the commerce of our own
            States and of the world with the products of our mines, our farms,
            and our factories, with the creations of our thought and the fruits
            of our character,—this is what will hold our attention and our
            enthusiasm steadily, now and in the years to come, as we strive to
            show in our life as a nation what liberty and the inspirations of an
            emancipated spirit may do for men and for societies, for
            individuals, for states, and for mankind.</p>

         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve"><render as="smallcap" rend="inherit">Governor Ralston, Ladies and
               Gentlemen</render>: You have given me a most royal welcome, for
            which I thank you from the bottom of my heart. It is rather lonely
            living in <place reg="Washington, DC" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Washington</place>. I have
            been confined for two years at hard labor, and even now I feel that
            I am simply out on parole. You notice that one of the most
            distinguished Members of the United States Senate is here to see
            that I go back. And yet, with sincere apologies to the Senate and
            House of Representatives, I want to say that I draw more inspirat on
            from you than I do from them. They, like myself, are only servants
            of the people of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place>. Our sinews
            consist in your sympathy and support, and our renewal comes from
            contact with you and with the strong movements of public opinion in
            the country.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">That is the reason why I for one would prefer that our
            thoughts should not too often cross the ocean, but should center
            themselves upon the policies and duties of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United
            States</place>. If we think rightly of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United
            States</place>, when the time comes we shall know how this country
            can serve the world. I will borrow a very interesting phrase from a
            distinguished gentleman of my acquaintance and beg that you will
            “keep your moral powder dry.”</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">But I have come here on Jackson Day. If there are
            Republicans present, I hope they will feel the compelling influences
            of such a day. There was nothing mild about <person refurl="x4000472" reg="Andrew Jackson" link-pointer-type="person">Andrew Jackson</person>; that is the reason I spoke of the
            “compelling influences” of the day. <person refurl="x4000472" reg="Andrew Jackson" link-pointer-type="person">Andrew
            Jackson</person> was a forthright man who believed everything he did
            believe in fighting earnest. And really, ladies and gentlemen, in
            public life that is the only sort of man worth thinking about for a
            moment. If I was not ready to fight for everything I believe in, I
            would think it my duty to go back and take a back seat. I like,
            therefore, to breathe the air of Jackson Day. I like to be reminded
            of the old militant hosts of Democracy which I believe have come to
            life again in our time. The <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> had almost
            forgotten that it must keep its fighting ardor in behalf of mankind
            when <person refurl="x4000472" reg="Andrew Jackson" link-pointer-type="person">Andrew Jackson</person> became
            President; and you will notice that whenever the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United
               States</place> forgets its ardor for mankind it is necessary that
            a Democrat should be elected President.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The trouble with the Republican Party is that it has
            not had a new idea for thirty years. I am not speaking as a
            politician; I am speaking as an historian. I have looked for new
            ideas in the records and I have not found any proceeding from the
            Republican ranks. They have had leaders from time to time who
            suggested new ideas, but they never did anything to carry them out.
            I suppose there was no harm in their talking, provided they could
            not do anything. Therefore, when it was necessary to say that we had
            talked about things long enough which it was necessary to do, and
            the time had come to do them, it was indispensable that a Democrat
            should be elected President.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I would not speak with disrespect of the Republican
            Party. I always speak with great respect of the past. The past was
            necessary to the present, and was a sure prediction of the future.
            The Republican Party is still a covert and refuge for those who are
            afraid, for those who want to consult their grandfathers about
            everything. You will notice that most of the advice taken by the
            Republican Party is taken from gentlemen old enough to be
            grandfathers, and that when they claim that a reaction has taken
            place, they react to the reelection of the oldest members of their
            party. They will not trust the youngsters. They are fraid the
            youngsters may have something up their sleeve.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">You will see, therefore, that I have come to you in
            the spirit of Jackson Day. I got very tired staying in <place reg="Washington, DC" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Washington</place> and saying sweet things.
            I wanted to come out and get contact with you once more and say what
            I really thought.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">My friends, what I particularly want you to observe is
            this, that politics in this country does not depend any longer upon
            the regular members of either party. There are not enough regular
            Republicans in this country to take and hold national power; and I
            must immediately add there are not enough regular Democrats in this
            country to do it, either. This country is guided and its policy is
            determined by the independent voter; and I have come to ask you how
            we can best prove to the independent voter that the instrument he
            needs is the Democratic Party, and that it would be hopeless for him
            to attempt to use the Republican Party. I do not have to prove it; I
            admit it.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">What seems to me perfectly evident is this: That if
            you made a rough reckoning, you would have to admit that only about
            one-third of the Republican Party is progressive; and you would also
            have to admit that about two-thirds of the Democratic Party is
            progressive. Therefore, the independent progressive voter finds a
            great deal more company in the Democratic ranks than in the
            Republican ranks. I say a great deal more, because there are
            Democrats who are sitting on the breeching strap: there are
            Democrats who are holding back; there are Democrats who are nervous.
            I dare say they were born with that temperament. And I respect the
            conservative temper. I claim to be an animated conservative myself,
            because being a conservative I understand to mean being a man not
            only who preserves what is best in the Nation but who sees that in
            order to preserve it you dare not stand still but must move forward.
            The virtue of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> is not statical; it is dynamic.
            All the forces of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> are forces in action or
            else they are forces of inertia.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">What I want to point out to you—and I believe that
            this is what the whole country is beginning to perceive—is this,
            that there is a larger body of men in the regular ranks of the
            Democratic Party who believe in the progressive policies of our day
            and mean to see them carried forward and perpetuated than there is
            in the ranks of the Republican Party. How can it be otherwise,
            gentlemen? The Democratic Party, and the only Democratic Party, has
            carried out the policies which the progressive people of this
            country have desired. There is not a single great act of this
            present great Congress which has not been carried out in obedience
            to the public opinion of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place>; and the public
            opinion of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> is not going to permit any body of
            men to go backward with regard to these great matters.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Let me instance a single thing: I want to ask the
            business men here present if this is not the first January in their
            recollection that did not bring a money stringency for the time
            being, because of the necessity of paying out great sums of money by
            way of dividends and the other settlements which come at the first
            of the year? I have asked the bankers if that happened this year,
            and they say, “No; it did not happen; it could not happen under the
            Federal Reserve Act.” We have emancipated the credits of this
            country; and is there anybody here who will doubt that the other
            policies that have given guaranty to this country that there will be
            free competition are policies which this country will never allow to
            be reversed? I have taken a long time, ladies and gentlemen, to
            select the Federal Trade Commission, because I wanted to choose men
            and be sure that I had chosen men who would be really serviceable to
            the business men of this country, great as well as small, the rank
            and file. These things have been done and will never be undone. They
            were talked about and talked about with futility until a Democratic
            Congress attempted and achieved them.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">But the Democratic Party is not to suppose that it is
            done with the business. The Democratic Party is still on trial. The
            Democratic Party still has to prove to the independent voters of the
            country not only that it believes in these things, but that it will
            continue to work along these lines and that it will not allow any
            enemy of these things to break its ranks. This country is not going
            to use any party that can not do continuous and consistent teamwork.
            If any group of men should dare to break the solidarity of the
            Democratic team for any purpose or from any motive, theirs will be a
            most unenviable notoriety and a responsibility which will bring deep
            bitterness to them. The only party that is serviceable to a nation
            is a party that can hold absolutely together and march with the
            discipline and with the zest of a conquering host.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I am not saying these things because I doubt that the
            Democratic Party will be able to do this, but because I believe that
            as leader for the time being of that party I can promise the country
            that it will do these things. I know my colleagues at <place reg="Washington, DC" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Washington</place>; I know their spirit and
            their purpose; and I know that they have the same emotion, the same
            high emotion of public service, that I hope I have.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I want at this juncture to pay my tribute of respect
            and of affectionate admiration for the two great Democratic Senators
            from the State of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Indiana</place>. I have never had to lie
            awake nights wondering what they were going to do. And the country
            is not going to trouble itself, ladies and gentlemen, to lie awake
            nights and wonder what men are going to do. If they have to do that,
            they will choose other men. Teamwork all the time is what they are
            going to demand of us, and that is our individual as well as our
            collective responsibility. That is what <person refurl="x4000472" reg="Andrew Jackson" link-pointer-type="person">Jackson</person>
            stands for. If a man will not play with the team, then he does not
            belong to the team. You see, I have spent a large part of my life in
            college and I know what a team means when I see it; and I know what
            the captain of a team must have if he is going to win. So it is no
            idle figure of speech with me.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Now, what is their duty? You say, “Hasn’t this
            Congress carried out a great program?” Yes, it has carried out a
            great program. It has had the most remarkable record that any
            Congress since the Civil War has had; and I say since the Civil War
            because I have not had time to think about those before the Civil
            War. But we are living at an extraordinary moment. The world has
            never been in the condition that it is in now, my friends. Half the
            world is on fire. Only <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> among the great powers
            of the world is free to govern her own life; and all the world is
            looking to <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> to serve its economic need. And
            while this is happening what is going on?</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Do you know, gentlemen, that the ocean freight rates
            have gone up in some instances to ten times their ordinary figure?
            and that the farmers of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place>, those who
            raise grain and those who raise cotton—these things that are
            absolutely necessary to the world as well as to ourselves—can not
            get their due profit out of the great prices that they are willing
            to pay for these things on the other side of the sea, because
            practically the whole profit is eaten up by the extortionate charges
            for ocean carriage? In the midst of this the Democrats propose a
            temporary measure of relief in a shipping bill. The merchants and
            the farmers of this country must have ships to carry their goods.
            Just at the present moment there is no other way of getting them
            than through the instrumentality that is suggested in the shipping
            bill. I hear it said in <place reg="Washington, DC" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Washington</place> on all hands that the Republicans in the United
            States Senate mean to talk enough to make the passage of that bill
            impossible. These self-styled friends of business, these men who say
            the Democratic party does not know what to do for business, are
            saying that the Democrats shall do nothing for business. I challenge
            them to show their right to stand in the way of the release of
            American products to the rest of the world! Who commissioned them—a
            minority, a lessening minority? (For they will be in a greater
            minority in the next Senate than in this.) You know it is the
            peculiarity of that great body that it has rules of procedure which
            make it possible for a minority to defy the Nation; and these
            gentlemen are now seeking to defy the Nation and prevent the release
            of American products to the suffering world which needs them more
            than it ever needed them before. Their credentials as friends of
            business and friends of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> will be badly
            discredited if they succeed. If I were speaking from a selfish,
            partisan point of view, I could wish nothing better than that they
            should show their true colors as partisans and succeed. But I am not
            quite so malevolent as that. Some of them are misguided: some of
            them are blind; most of them are ignorant. I would rather pray for
            them than abuse them. The great voice of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place>
            ought to make them understand what they are said to be attempting
            now really means. I have to say “are said to be attempting,” because
            they do not come and tell me that they are attempting them. I do not
            know why. I would express my opinion of them in parliamentary
            language, but I would express it, I hope, no less plainly because
            couched in the terms of courtesy. This country is bursting its
            jacket, and they are seeing to it that the jacket is not only kept
            tight but is riveted with steel.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The Democratic Party does know how to serve business
            in this country, and its future program is a program of service. We
            have cleared the decks. We have laid the lines now upon which
            business that was to do the country harm shall be stopped and an
            economic control which was intolerable shall be broken up. We have
            emancipated <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place>, but <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> must
            do something with her freedom. There are great bills pending in the
            United States Senate just now that have been passed by the House of
            Representatives, which are intended as constructive measures in
            behalf of business—one great measure which will make available the
            enormous water powers of this country for the industry of it;
            another bill which will unlock the resources of the public domain
            which the Republicans, desiring to save, locked up so that nobody
            could use them.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The reason I say the Republicans have not had a new
            idea in thirty years is that they have not known how to do anything
            except sit on the lid. If you can release the steam so that it will
            drive great industries, it is not necessary to sit on the lid. What
            we are trying to do in the great conservation bill is to carry out
            for the first time in the history of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United
            States</place> a system by which the great resources of this country
            can be used instead of being set aside so that no man can get at
            them. I shall watch with a great deal of interest what the
            self-styled friends of business try to do to those bills. Do not
            misunderstand me. There are some men on that side of the Chamber who
            understand the value of these things and are standing valiantly by
            them, but they are a small minority. The majority that is standing
            by them is on our side of the Chamber, and they are the friends of
               <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place>.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">But there are other things which we have to do.
            Sometimes when I look abroad, my friends, and see the great mass of
            struggling humanity on this continent, it goes very much to <sic corr="my">may</sic> heart to see how many men are at a
            disadvantage and are without guides and helpers. Don’t you think it
            would be a pretty good idea for the Democratic Party to undertake a
            systematic method of helping the workingmen of
            <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place>? There is one very simple way in which they
            can help the workingmen. If you were simply to establish a great
            Federal employment bureau, it would do a vast deal. By the Federal
            agencies which spread over this country men could be directed to
            those parts of the country, to those undertakings, to those tasks
            where they could find profitable employment. The labor of this
            country needs to be guided from opportunity to opportunity. We
            proved it the other day. We were told that in two States of the
            Union 30,000 men were needed to gather the crops. We suggested in a
            Cabinet meeting that the Department of Labor should have printed
            information about this in such form that it could be posted up in
            the post offices all over the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place>, and that
            the Department of Labor should get in touch with the labor
            departments of the States, so that notice could go out from them,
            and their cooperation obtained. What was the result? Those 30,000
            men were found and were sent to the places where they got profitable
            employment. I do not know any one thing that has happened in my
            administration that made me feel happier than that—that the job and
            the man had been brought together. It will not cost a great deal of
            money and it will do a great deal of service if the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United
               States</place> were to undertake to do such things systematically
            and all the year round; and I for my part hope that it will do that.
            If I were writing an additional plank for a Democratic platform, I
            would put that in.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">There is another thing that needs very much to be
            done. I am not one of those who doubt either the industry or the
            learning or the integrity of the courts of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United
            States</place>, but I do know that they have a very antiquated way
            of doing business. I do know that the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place>
            in its judicial procedure is many decades behind every other
            civilized Government in the world, and I say that it is an immediate
            and an imperative call upon us to rectify that, because the
            speediness of justice, the inexpensiveness of justice, the ready
            access to justice, is the greater part of justice itself. If you
            have to be rich to get justice, because of the cost of the very
            process itself, then there is no justice at all. So I say this is
            another direction in which we ought to be very quick to see the
            signs of the times and to help those who need to be helped.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Then there is something else. The Democrats have heard
            the Republicans talking about the scientific way in which to handle
            a tariff, though the Republicans have never given any exhibition of
            a knowledge of how to handle it scientifically. If it is scientific
            to put additional profits into the hands of those who are already
            getting the greater part of the profits, then they have been
            exceedingly scientific. It has been the science of selfishness; it
            has been the science of privilege. That kind of science I do not
            care to know anything about except enough to stop it. But if by
            scientific treatment of the tariff they mean adjustment to the
            actual trade conditions of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> and the world,
            then I am with them; and I want to call their attention—for though
            they voted for it they apparently have not noticed it—to the fact
            that the bill which creates the new Trade Commission does that very
            thing. We were at pains to see that it was put in there. That
            commission is authorized and empowered to inquire into and report to
            Congress not only upon all the conditions of trade in this country,
            but upon the conditions of trade, the cost of manufacture, the cost
            of transportation—all the things that enter into the question of the
            tariff—in foreign countries and into all those questions of foreign
            combinations which affect international trade between
            <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Europe</place> and the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place>. It has
            the full powers which will guide Congress in the scientific
            treatment of questions of international trade. Being by profession a
            schoolmaster, I am glad to point that out to the class of
            uninstructed Republicans, though I have not always taught in the
            primary grade.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">At every turn the things that the progressive
            Republicans have proposed that were practicable, the Democrats
            either have done or are immediately proposing to do. If that is not
            our bill of particulars to satisfy the independent voters of the
            country, I would like to have one produced. There are things that
            the Progressive program contained which we, being constitutional
            lawyers, happened to know can not be done by the Congress of the
            United States. That is a detail which they seem to have overlooked.
            But so far as they can be done by State legislatures, I, for one,
            speaking for one Democrat, am heartily in favor of their being done.
            Because Democrats do not congregate merely in <place reg="Washington, DC" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Washington</place>. They congregate also in
            the State capitols, and they congregate there in very influential
            numbers and with very influential organizations.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Just before I came away from <place reg="Washington, DC" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Washington</place> I was going over some of
            the figures of the last elections, the elections of November last.
            The official returns have not all come in yet. I do not know why
            they are so slow in getting to us, but so far as they have come in
            they have given me this useful information, that taking the States
            where Senators were elected, and where Senators were not elected
            taking the election of Governors, and where Governors were not
            elected taking the returns for the State legislatures or for the
            Congressional delegates, the Democrats, reckoning State by State,
            would, if it had been a presidential year, have had a majority of
            about eighty in the Electoral College. Fortunately or unfortunately,
            this is not a presidential year; but the thing is significant to me
            for this reason. A great many people have been speaking of the
            Democratic Party as a minority party. Well, if it is, it is not so
            much of a minority party as the Republican, and as between the
            minorities I think we can claim to belong to the larger minority.
            The moral of that is merely what I have already been pointing out to
            you, that neither party in its regular membership has a majority. I
            do not want to make the independent voter too proud of himself, but
            I have got to admit that he is our boss; and I am bound to admit
            that the things that he wants are, so far as I have seen them
            mentioned, things that I want.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I am not an independent voter, but I hope I can claim
            to be an independent person, and I want to say this distinctly: I do
            not love any party any longer than it continues to serve the
            immediate and pressing needs of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place>. I have been
            bred in the Democratic Party; I love the Democratic Party; but I
            love <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> a great deal more than I love the
            Democratic Party; and when the Democratic Party thinks that it is an
            end in itself, then I rise up and dissent. It is a means to an end,
            and its power depends, and ought to depend, upon its showing that it
            knows what <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> needs and is ready to give it what
            it needs. That is the reason I say to the independent voter you have
            got us in the palm of your hand. I do not happen to be one of your
            number but I recognize your supremacy, because I read the election
            returns; and I have this ambition, my Democratic friends—I can avow
            it on Jackson Day—I want to make every independent voter in this
            country a Democrat. It is a little cold and lonely out where he is,
            because, though he holds the balance of power, he is not the
            majority, and I want him to come in where it is warm. I want him to
            come in where there is a lot of good society, good companionship,
            where there are great emotions. That is what I miss in the
            Republican Party; they do not seem to have any great emotions. They
            seem to think a lot of things, old things, but they do not seem to
            have any enthusiasm about anything.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">There is one thing I have got a great enthusiasm
            about, I might almost say a reckless enthusiasm, and that is human
            liberty. The Governor has just now spoken about watchful waiting in
               <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Mexico</place>. I want to say a word about
            <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Mexico</place>, or not so much about <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Mexico</place> as
            about our attitude towards <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Mexico</place>. I hold it as a
            fundamental principle, and so do you, that every people has the
            right to determine its own form of government; and until this recent
            revolution in <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Mexico</place>, until the end of the <person refurl="x4008060" reg="Porfirio Diaz" link-pointer-type="person">Diaz</person> reign, eighty per cent of the
            people of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Mexico</place> never had a “look in” in determining
            who should be their governors or what their government should be.
            Now, I am for the eighty per cent! It is none of my business, and it
            is none of your business, how long they take in determining it. It
            is none of my business, and it is none of yours, how they go about
            the business. The country is theirs. The Government is theirs. The
            liberty, if they can get it, and Godspeed them in getting it, is
            theirs. And so far as my influence goes while I am President nobody
            shall interfere with them.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">That is what I mean by a great emotion, the great
            emotion of sympathy. Do you suppose that the American people are
            ever going to count a small amount of material benefit and advantage
            to people doing business in <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Mexico</place> against the
            liberties and the permanent happiness of the Mexican people? Have
            not European nations taken as long as they wanted and spilt as much
            blood as they pleased in settling their affairs, and shall we deny
            that to <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Mexico</place> because she is weak? No, I say! I am
            proud to belong to a strong nation that says, “This country which we
            could crush shall have just as much freedom in her own affairs as we
            have.” If I am strong, I am ashamed to bully the weak. In proportion
            to my strength is my pride in withholding that strength from the
            oppression of another people. And I know when I speak these things,
            not merely from the generous response with which they have just met
            from you, but from my long-time knowledge of the American people,
            that that is the sentiment of this great people. With all due
            respect to editors of great newspapers, I have to say to them that I
            seldom take my opinion of the American people from their editorials.
            When some great dailies not very far from where I am temporarily
            residing thundered with rising scorn at watchful waiting, my
            confidence was not for a moment shaken. I knew what were the temper
            and principles of the American people. If I did not at least think I
            knew, I would emigrate, because I would not be satisfied to stay
            where I am. There may come a time when the American people will have
            to judge whether I know what I am talking about or not, but at least
            for two years more I am free to think that I do, with a great
            comfort in immunity in the time being.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">It is, by the way, a very comforting thought that the
            next Congress of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> is going to be
            very safely Democratic and that, therefore, we can all together feel
            as much confidence as <person refurl="x4000472" reg="Andrew Jackson" link-pointer-type="person">Jackson</person> did that we know what
            we are about. You know <person refurl="x4000472" reg="Andrew Jackson" link-pointer-type="person">Jackson</person>
            used to think that everybody who disagreed with him was an enemy of
            the country. I have never got quite that far in my thought, but I
            have ventured to think that they did not know what they were talking
            about, knowing that my fellow Democrats expected me to live up to
            the full stature of Jacksonian Democracy.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I feel, my friends, in a very confident mood <word altform="today">to-day</word>. I feel confident that we do know
            the spirit of the American people, that we do know the program of
            betterment which it will be necessary for us to undertake, that we
            do have a very reasonable confidence in the support of the American
            people. I have been talking with business men recently about the
            present state of mind of American business. There is nothing the
            matter with American business except a state of mind. I understand
            that your chamber of commerce here in <place reg="Indianapolis, IN" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Indianapolis</place> is working now upon the motto “If you are
            going to buy it, buy it now.” That is a perfectly safe maxim to act
            on. It is just as safe to buy it now as it ever will be, and if you
            start the buying there will be no end to it, and you will be a
            seller as well as a buyer. I am just as sure of that as I can be,
            because I have taken counsel with the men who know. I never was in
            business and, therefore, I have none of the prejudices of business.
            I have looked on and tried to see what the interests of the country
            were in business; I have taken counsel with men who did know, and
            their counsel is uniform, that all that is needed in
            <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> now is to believe in the future; and I can
            assure you as one of those who speak for the Democratic Party that
            it is perfectly safe to believe in the future. We are so much the
            friends of business that we were for a little time the enemies of
            those who were trying to control business. I say “for a little time”
            because we are now reconciled to them. They have graciously admitted
            that we had a right to do what we did do, and they have very
            handsomely said that they were going to play the game.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I believe—I always have believed—that American
            business men were absolutely sound at heart, but men immersed in
            business do a lot of things that opportunity offers which in other
            circumstances they would not do; and I have thought all along that
            all that was necessary to do was to call their attention sharply to
            the kind of reforms in business which were needed and that they
            would acquiesce. Why, I believe they have heartily acquiesced. There
            is all the more reason, therefore, that, great and small, we should
            be confident in the future.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">And what a future it is, my friends! Look abroad upon
            the troubled world! Only <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> at peace! Among all
            the great powers of the world only <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> saving her
            power for her own people! Only <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> using her
            great character and her great strength in the interests of peace and
            of prosperity! Do you not think it likely that the world will some
            time turn to <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> and say, “You were right and we
            were wrong. You kept your head when we lost ours. You tried to keep
            the scale from tipping, and we threw the whole weight of arms in one
            side of the scale. Now, in your self-possession, in your coolness,
            in your strength, may we not turn to you for counsel and for
            assistance?” Think of the deep-wrought destruction of economic
            resources, of life, and of hope that is taking place in some parts
            of the world, and think of the reservoir of hope, the reservoir of
            energy, the reservoir of sustenance that there is in this great land
            of plenty! May we not look forward to the time when we shall be
            called blessed among the nations, because we succored the nations of
            the world in their time of distress and of dismay? I for one pray
            God that that solemn hour may come, and I know the solidity of
            character and I know the exaltation of hope, I know the big
            principle with which the American people will respond to the call of
            the world for this service. I thank God that those who believe in
               <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place>, who try to serve her people, are likely
            to be also what <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> herself from the first hoped
            and meant to be—the servant of mankind.</p>

               Representatives</render>:</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">It is with unaffected regret that I find myself
            constrained by clear conviction to return this bill (H. R. 6060, “An
            act to regulate the immigration of aliens to and the residence of
            aliens in the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place>”) without my signature.
            Not only do I feel it to be a very serious matter to exercise the
            power of veto in any case, because it involves opposing the single
            judgment of the President to the judgment of a majority of both the
            Houses of the Congress, a step which no man who realizes his own
            liability to error can take without great hesitation, but also
            because this particular bill is in so many important respects
            admirable, well conceived, and desirable. Its enactment into law
            would undoubtedly enhance the efficiency and improve the methods of
            handling the important branch of the public service to which it
            relates. But candor and a sense of duty with regard to the
            responsibility so clearly imposed upon me by the Constitution in
            matters of legislation leave me no choice but to dissent.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">In two particulars of vital consequence this bill
            embodies a radical departure from the traditional and
            long-established policy of this country, a policy in which our
            people have conceived the very character of their Government to be
            expressed, the very mission and spirit of the Nation in respect of
            its relations to the peoples of the world outside their borders. It
            seeks to all but close entirely the gates of <sic corr="asylum">asylumn</sic> which have always been open to those who could
            find nowhere else the right and opportunity of constitutional
            agition for what they conceived to be the natural and inalienable
            rights of men; and it excludes these to whom the opportunities of
            elementary education have been denied, without regard to their
            character, their purposes, or their natural capacity.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Restrictions like these, adopted earlier in our
            history as a Nation, would very materially have altered the course
            and cooled the humane ardors of our politics. The right of political
            asylum has brought to this country many a man of noble character and
            elevated purpose who was marked as an outlaw in his own less
            fortunate land, and who has yet become an ornament to our
            citizenship and to our public councils. The children and the
            compatriots of these illustrious Americans must stand amazed to see
            the representatives of their Nation now resolved, in the fullness of
            our national strength and at the maturity of our great institutions,
            to risk turning such men back from our shores without test of
            quality or purpose. It is difficult for me to believe that the full
            effect of this feature of the bill was realized when it was framed
            and adopted, and it is impossible for me to assent to it in the form
            in which it is here cast.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The literacy test and the tests and restrictions which
            accompany it constitute an even more radical change in the policy of
            the Nation. Hitherto we have generously kept our doors open to all
            who were not unfitted by reason of disease or incapacity for
            self-support or such personal records and antecedents as were likely
            to make them a menace to our peace and order or to the wholesome and
            essential relationships of life. In this bill it is proposed to turn
            away from tests of character and of quality and impose tests which
            exlude and <sic corr="restrict">rstrict</sic>; for the new tests
            here embodied are not tests of quality or of character or of
            personal fitness, but tests of opportunity. Those who come seeking
            opportunity are not to be admitted unless they have already had one
            of the chief of the opportunities they seek, the opportunity of
            education. The object of such provisions is restriction, not
            selection.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">If the people of this country have made up their minds
            to limit the number of immigrants by arbitrary tests and so reverse
            the policy of all the generations of Americans that have gone before
            them, it is their right to do so. I am their servant and have no
            license to stand in their way. But I do not believe that they have.
            I respectfully submit that no one can quote their mandate to that
            effect. Has any political party ever avowed a policy of restriction
            in this fundamental matter, gone to the country on it, and been
            commissioned to control its legislation? Does this bill rest upon
            the conscious and universal assent and desire of the American
            people? I doubt it. It is because I doubt it that I make bold to
            dissent from it. I am willing to abide by the verdict, but not until
            it has been rendered. Let the platforms of parties speak out upon
            this policy and the people pronounce their wish. The matter is too
            fundamental to be settled otherwise.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I have no pride of opinion in this question. I am not
            foolish enough to profess to know the wishes and ideals of
               <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> better than the body of her chosen
            representatives know them. I only want instruction direct from those
            whose fortunes, with ours and all men’s, are involved.</p>

         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Mr. <render as="smallcap" rend="inherit">President, Ladies and
               Gentlemen</render>: It is a real pleasure to me to be here and to
            look this company in the face. I know how important the interests
            that you represent are. I know that they represent some of the chief
            channels through which the vigor and activity of the nation flow. I
            am also very glad indeed to have you come and look at some portion,
            at any rate, of the Government of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place>.
            Many things are reported and supposed about that Government and it
            is thoroughly worth your while to come and see for yourselves.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I have always maintained that the only way in which
            men could understand one another was by meeting one another. If I
            believed all that I read in the newspapers, I would not understand
            anybody. I have met many men whose horns dropped away the moment I
            was permitted to examine their heads. For, after all, in a vast
            country like this the most difficult thing is a common
            understanding. We are constantly forming get-together associations,
            and I sometimes think that we make the mistake of confining those
            associations in their membership to those who are interested only in
            some one particular group of the various industries of the country.
            The important thing is for the different enterprises of the country
            to understand one another; and the most important thing of all is
            for us to comprehend our life as a nation and understand each other
            as fellow citizens.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">It seems to me that I can say with a good deal of
            confidence that we are upon the eve of a new era of enterprise and
            of prosperity. Enterprise has been checked in this country for
            almost twenty years, because men were moving amongst a maze of
            interrogation points. They did not know what was going to happen to
            them. All sorts of regulation were proposed, and it was a matter of
            uncertainty what sort of regulation was going to be adopted. All
            sorts of charges were made against business, as if business were at
            fault, when most men knew that the great majority of business men
            were honest, were public-spirited, were intending the right thing,
            and the many were made afraid because the few did not do what was
            right.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The most necessary thing, therefore, was for us to
            agree, as we did by slow stages agree, upon the main particulars of
            what ought not to be done and then to put our laws in such shape as
            to correspond with that general judgment. That, I say, was a
            necessary preliminary not only to a common understanding, but also
            to a universal cooperation. The great forces of a country like this
            can not pull separately; they have got to pull together. And except
            upon a basis of common understanding as to the law and as to the
            proprieties of conduct, it is impossible to pull together. I, for
            one, have never doubted that all <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> was of one
            principle. I have never doubted that all <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place>
            believed in doing what was fair and honorable and of good report.
            But the method, the method of control by law against the small
            minority that was recalcitrant against these principles, was a thing
            that it was difficult to determine upon; and it was a very great
            burden, let me say, to fall upon a particular administration of this
            Government to have to undertake practically the whole business of
            final definition. That is what has been attempted by the Congress
            now about to come to a close. It has attempted the definitions for
            which the country had been getting ready, or trying to get ready,
            for half a generation. It will require a period of test to determine
            whether they have successfully defined them or not; but no one needs
            to have it proved to him that it was necessary to define them and
            remove the uncertainties, and that, the uncertainties being removed,
            common understandings are possible and a universal cooperation.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">You, gentlemen, representing these arteries of which I
            have spoken, that serve to release the forces of communities and
            serve, also, to bind community with community, are surely in a
            better position than the men perhaps of any other profession to
            understand how communities constitute units—how even a nation
            constitutes a unit; and that what is detrimental and hurtful to a
            part you, above all men, ought to know is detrimental to all. You
            can not demoralize some of the forces of a community without being
            in danger of demoralizing all the forces of a community. Your
            interest is not in the congestion of life, but in the release of
            life. Your interest is not in isolation, but in union, the union of
            parts of this great country, so that every energy in those parts
            will flow freely and with full force from county to county
            throughout the whole nation.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">What I have come to speak of this afternoon is this
            unity of our interest, and I want to make some—I will not say
            “predictions,” but to use a less dangerous though bigger
            word—prognostications. I understand that there is among the medical
            profession diagnosis and prognosis. I dare say the prognosis is more
            difficult than the diagnosis, since it has to come first; and not
            being a physician, I have all the greater courage in the prognosis.
            I have noticed all my life that I could speak with the greatest
            freedom about those things that I did not understand; but there are
            some things that a man is bound to try to think out whether he fully
            comprehends them or not. The thought of no single man can comprehend
            the life of a great Nation like this, and yet men in public life
            upon whom the burden of guidance is laid must attempt to comprehend
            as much of it as they can. Their strength will lie in common
            counsel; their strength will lie in taking counsel of as many
            informed persons as possible in each department with which they had
            to deal; but some time or other the point will come when they have
            to make a decision based upon a prognosis. We have had to do that in
            attempting the definitions of law which have been attempted by this
            Congress, and now it is necessary for us, in order to go forward
            with the confident spirit with which I believe we can go forward, to
            look ahead and see the things that are likely to happen.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">In the first place, I feel that the mists and miasmic
            airs of suspicion that have filled the business world have now been
            blown away. I believe that we have passed the era of suspicion and
            have come into the era of confidence. Knowing the elements we have
            to deal with, we can deal with them; and with that confidence of
            knowledge we can have confidence of enterprise. That enterprise is
            going to mean this: Nobody is henceforth going to be afraid of or
            suspicious of any business merely because it is big. If my judgment
            is correct, nobody has been suspicious of any business merely
            because it was big; but they have been suspicious whenever they
            thought that the bigness was being used to take an unfair advantage.
            We all have to admit that it is easier for a big fellow to take
            advantage of you than for a little fellow to take advantage of you;
            therefore, we instinctively watch the big fellow with a little
            closer scrutiny than we watch the little fellow. But, bond having
            been given for the big fellow, we can sleep o’nights. Bond having
            been given that he will keep the peace, we do not have to spend our
            time and waste our energy watching him. The conditions of confidence
            being established, nobody need think that if he is taller than the
            rest anybody is going to throw a stone at him simply because he is a
            favorable target—always provided there is fair dealing and real
            service.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Because the characteristic of modern business,
            gentlemen, is this: The number of cases in which men do business on
            their own individual, private capital is relatively small in our
            day. Almost all the greater enterprises are done on what is, so far
            as the managers of that business are concerned, other people’s
            money. That is what a joint-stock company means. It means, “Won’t
            you lend us your resources to conduct this business and trust us, a
            little group of managers, to see that you get honest and proper
            returns for your money?” and no man who manages a joint-stock
            company can know for many days together, without fresh inquiry, who
            his partners are, because the stock is constantly changing hands,
            and the partners are seldom the same people for long periods
            together. Which amounts to saying that, inasmuch as you are using
            the money of everybody who chooses to come in, your responsibility
            is to everybody who has come in or who may come in. That is simply
            another way of saying that your business is, so far forth, a public
            business, and you owe it to the public to take them into your
            confidence in regard to the way in which it is conducted.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The era of private business in the sense of business
            conducted with the money of the partners—I mean of the managing
            partners—is practically passed, not only in this country, but almost
            everywhere. Therefore, almost all business has this direct
            responsibility to the public in general: We owe a constant report to
            the public, whose money we are constantly asking for in order to
            conduct the business itself. Therefore, we have got to trade not
            only on our efficiency, not only on the service that we render, but
            on the confidence that we cultivate. There is a new atmosphere for
            business. The oxygen that the lungs of modern business takes in is
            the oxygen of the public confidence, and if you have not got that,
            your business is essentially paralyzed and asphyxiated.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I take it that we are in a position now to come to a
            common understanding, knowing that only a common understanding will
            be the stable basis of business, and that what we want for business
            hereafter is the same kind of liberty that we want for the
            individual. The liberty of the individual is limited with the
            greatest sharpness where his actions come into collision with the
            interests of the community he lives in. My liberty consists in a
            sort of parole. Society says to me, “You may do what you please
            until you do something that is in violation of the common
            understanding, of the public interest; then your parole is
            forfeited. We will take you into custody. We will limit your
            activities. We will penalize you if you use this thing that you call
            your liberty against our interest.” Business does not want, and
            ought not to ask for, more liberty than the individual has; and I
            have always in my own thought summed up individual liberty, and
            business liberty, and every other kind of liberty, in the phrase
            that is common in the sporting world, “A free field and no favor.”</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">There have been times—I will not specify them, but
            there have been times—when the field looked free, but when there
            were favors received from the managers of the course; when there
            were advantages given; inside tracks accorded; practices which would
            block the other runners; rules which would exclude the amateur who
            wanted to get in. That may be a free field, but there is favor,
            there is partiality, there is preference, there is covert advantage
            taken of somebody, and while it looks very well from the grand
            stand, there are men whom you can find who were not allowed to get
            in to the track and test their powers against the other men who were
            racing for the honors of the day.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I think it is a serviceable figure. It means this:
            That you are not going to be barred from the contest because you are
            big and strong, and you are not going to be penalized because you
            are big and strong, but you are going to be made to observe the
            rules of the track and not get in anybody’s way except as you can
            keep ahead of him by having more vigor and skill than he has. When
            we get that understanding, that we are all sports, and that we are
            not going to ask for, not only, but we are not going to condescend
            to take, advantage of anything that does not belong to us, then the
            atmosphere will clear so that it will seem as if the sun had never
            shone as it does that day. It is the spirit of true sportsmanship
            that ought to get into everything, and men who, when they get beaten
            that way, squeal do not deserve our pity.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Some men are going to get beaten because they have not
            the brains; they have not the initiative; they have not the skill;
            they have not the knowledge; they have not the same capacity that
            other men have. They will have to be employees; they will have to be
            used where they can be used. We do not need to conceal from
            ourselves that there are varieties of capacity in the world. Some
            men have heads, but they are not particularly furnished. I overheard
            two men one day talking about a third man, and one of them referred
            to his head. “Head?” the other said, “Head? That isn’t a head;
            that’s just a knot the Almighty put there to keep him from raveling
            out!” We have to admit that there are such persons. Now, liberty
            does not consist in framing laws to put such men at the front and
            demand that they be allowed to keep pace with the rest; because that
            would hold the whole process of civilization back. But it does
            consist in saying no matter how featherweight the other man is you
            must not arbitrarily interfere with him; that there must be an
            absolutely free field and no favor to anybody.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">There are, therefore, I suppose, certain rules of the
            game. I will mention what seem to me some of them. I have already
            mentioned one of them by way of illustration. First of all is the
            rule of publicity: not doing anything under cover; letting the
            public know what you are doing and judge of it according as it is.
            There are a great many businesses in this country that have fallen
            under suspicion because they were so secretive, when there was
            nothing to secrete that was dishonorable. The minute I keep
            everything in my pocket and will not show anybody what is there,
            they conjecture what may be in my pocket; whereas, if I turn my
            pockets inside out, the conjecture is, at any rate, dissipated.
            There is no use inviting suspicion by secretiveness. If a business
            is being honorably done and successfully done, you ought to be
            pleased to turn it inside out and let the people whom you are
            inviting to invest in it see exactly how it is done and with what
            results. Publicity, which is required in sport, is required in
            business. Let’s see how you are running the game!</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Then, in the second place, is giving a full equivalent
            for the money you receive, the full equivalent in service; not
            trying to skimp in the service in order to increase profits above a
            reasonable return, but trying to make the profits proportioned to
            the satisfaction of the people that you serve. There isn’t any more
            solid foundation for business than that. If you thoroughly satisfy
            the people you are serving you are welcome to their money. They are
            not going to grudge it, because they will feel that they are getting
            a <render as="italic" rend="inherit">quid pro quo;</render> they are getting
            something such as was promised them when their money was asked of
            them.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Then, in the third place, this game requires something
            more than ordinary sport. It requires a certain kind of conscience
            in business, a certain feeling that we are, after all, in this world
            because we are expected to make good according to the standards of
            the people we live with. That, after all, gentlemen, is the chief
            compulsion that is laid on all of us. I am not aware of being afraid
            of jail; I do not feel uneasy when I pass a penitentiary; but I
            would feel extremely uneasy if I knew I had done something which
            some fine, honorable friend of mine would condemn if it passed
            before him. I would look carefully at his eyes to see if he
            suspected anything, and I would feel unhappy until I had made a
            clean breast of it with him. That is what we are afraid of, and that
            is what we ought to be afraid of. We are sustained by the moral
            judgment of honorable men; and there isn’t anything else in this
            world that I know of that is worth while. How honors must hurt a man
            if he feels that they have been achieved dishonorably! They then are
            an arrow in his heart, not a quickening or a tonic to his spirit in
            any respect. If he feels that he has cheated the people who trusted
            him, then, no matter what fortunes he piles up, they never can
            contribute to his peace of mind for a moment. So I say that
            conscience in business is the motive spring of the whole thing—the
            pride of doing the thing as it ought to be done.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I ask every man in this room who employs other men if
            he would not pay the best salary he has if he could be assured that
            the man he employed was of that quality. You know that is the sort
            of men that you want, the men who will take a pride in doing the
            thing right and have a clean conscience toward you who employ them.
            Now, all of us are employees of the public. It doesn’t make any
            difference what our business is or how small it is, we are, so far
            as we get money for it, employees of the public; and our clear,
            clean consciences toward our employers are the basis of our success
            and, it goes without saying, the basis of our happiness.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Then, the fourth rule, as it seems to me, is the rule
            of having the spirit of service. I know a lot of cant is talked
            about that, and I get very sick of the cant, as I dare say you do;
            but when I talk about the spirit of service I am not meaning a
            sentiment. I am not meaning a state of mind. I am meaning something
            very concrete—that you want to see to it that the thing that you do
            for the public and get money for is the best thing of that kind that
            can be done. That is what I mean by the spirit of service. I have
            known many a man who gave up profit for mental satisfaction. I know
            men in this city—there are men in the scientific bureaux of this
            Government whom I could cite—who could make very big salaries, but
            who prefer the satisfaction of doing things that will serve the
            whole community, and doing them just as well as they possibly can be
            done. I, for one, am proud of the scientific bureaux of this
            Government. There are men in them of the most self-sacrificing
            spirit and of the highest scientific efficiency, who do things on a
            petty salary which some other men would not do at all; for if you
            have to pay a man a salary to produce the best product of his brain,
            then he scales the product down to the salary. Here are men who
            scale the product up to the highest standards of scientific ideals!
            They have hitched their wagons to a star, and the star is apt to
            lift their names above the names of the rest of us. So I say that if
            your earning capacity is the capacity to earn the public confidence,
            you can go about your business like freemen. Nobody is going to
            molest you and everybody is going to say, “If you earn big profits;
            if you have treated the people from whom you are making your profits
            as they ought to be treated; if you treat the employees whom you use
            in earning those profits as they ought to be treated; if your
            methods of competition are clean and above reproach; why, then, you
            can pile those profits as high as the Rockies and nobody will be
            jealous of it.” Because you will have earned them in a sense that is
            the handsomest sense of all.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">It is in this spirit that we all ought to regard the
            laws, that we all ought to criticise the laws, and that we all ought
            to cooperate in the enforcement of the laws. Government, gentlemen,
            is merely an attempt to express the conscience of everybody, the
            average conscience of the Nation, in the rules that everybody is
            commanded to obey. That is all they are. If the Government is going
            faster than the public conscience, it will presently have to pull
            up. If it is not going as fast as the public conscience, it will
            presently have to be whipped up. Because the public conscience is
            going to say, “We want our laws to express our character;” and our
            character must have this kind of solidity underneath it, the moral
            judgment of right and wrong. The only reason we quarrel with
            reformers sometimes is because they are, or suppose that they are, a
            little more enlightened than the rest of us, and they want us all of
            a sudden to be just as enlightened as they are, and we can not stand
            the pace. That is all that makes us uneasy about reformers. If we
            could get our second wind, if we could keep up the pace as long as
            they do, we might be able to run as fast as they do, but we are more
            heavily weighted with clay than they are. We can not go as fast. And
            we like companionship. We want to wait for the rest of them. We do
            not want to be in a lonely advance climbing some heights of
            perfection where there is no good inn to stop at overnight.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">That, gentlemen, is the homely and, I dare say,
            obvious lesson which I have meant to give utterance to this
            afternoon. I think that I understand what you are after. I hope that
            you understand what we are after. All I ask is that if anything is
            being done that ought not to be done, the fault in it be
            conclusively pointed out and the way to correct the mistake be
            explicitly shown. There is an old rule that ought to obtain in
            politics as in everything else, and it is expressed in a very homely
            way. It is the rule of “Put up or shut up.” Some one said, “If you
            wish me to consider you witty, I must really trouble you to make a
            joke.” If you wish me to consider you wise, I must really trouble
            you to show the concrete proof; to show how the thing can be done;
            to show how it can be better done. Because nobody is fool enough to
            suppose that the way he has determined that the thing ought to be
            done is necessarily the best way to do it. But it is the best way to
            do it until you show a better way. That is a perfectly obvious rule.
            So, again, I say it is the rule of “Put up or shut up.” And I do not
            mean that in any sort of disrespect. The market for ideas is a
            highly competitive market, and the rules of competition are
            necessarily fair. There is only one test for an idea and that is,
            “Is it good?” You may for the time being dress it with such rhetoric
            that it will look good, and the best thing that characterizes
            countries like our own is that every man who has an idea is
            constantly invited to the platform. There is nothing better for an
            idea by way of test than exposure to the atmosphere. If you let
            enough people hear it stated often enough, it will certainly seek
            its proper level.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">That is the reason I believe in free speech. I have
            been subjected to free speech myself, and it is hard to endure
            sometimes, because the office of the President seems to be the
            clearing house for original ideas. I am brought more original ideas
               <render as="italic" rend="inherit">per diem</render>, I dare say, than any other
            person in the country and, therefore, pay the penalty of freedom of
            speech. Perhaps my mind does not register original ideas readily
            enough, because some of them do not register at all. I am perfectly
            willing to admit that that is the fault of the register, not the
            fault of the idea. All I have to say to you is that if you have
            ideas, the register is entirely at your service.</p>

         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Mr. <render as="smallcap" rend="inherit">President, Ladies and
               Gentlemen</render>: I feel that it is hardly fair to you for me
            to come in in this casual fashion among a body of men who have been
            seriously discussing great questions, and it is hardly fair to me,
            because I come in cold, not having had the advantage of sharing the
            atmosphere of your deliberations and catching the feeling of your
            conference. Moreover, I hardly know just how to express my interest
            in the things you are undertaking. When a man stands outside an
            organization and speaks to it he is too apt to have the tone of
            outside commendation, as who should say, “I would desire to pat you
            on the back and say ‘Good boys; you are doing well!’” I would a
            great deal rather have you receive me as if for the time being I
            were one of your own number.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Because the longer I occupy the office that I now
            occupy the more I regret any lines of separation; the more I deplore
            any feeling that one set of men has one set of interests and another
            set of men another set of interests; the more I feel the solidarity
            of the Nation—the impossibility of separating one interest from
            another without misconceiving it; the necessity that we should all
            understand one another, in order that we may understand ourselves.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">There is an illustration which I have used a great
            many times. I will use it again, because it is the most serviceable
            to my own mind. We often speak of a man who can not find his way in
            some jungle or some desert as having “lost himself.” Did you never
            reflect that that is the only thing he has not lost? <render as="italic" rend="inherit">He</render> is <render rend="inherit" as="italic">there</render>. He has lost
            the rest of the world. He has no fixed point by which to steer. He
            does not know which is north, which is south, which is east, which
            is west; and if he did know, he is so confused that he would not
            know in which of those directions his goal lay. Therefore, following
            his heart, he walks in a great circle from right to left and comes
            back to where he started—to himself again. To my mind that is a
            picture of the world. If you have lost sight of other interests and
            do not know the relation of your own interests to those other
            interests, then you do not understand your own interests, and have
            lost yourself. What you want is orientation, relationship to the
            points of the compass; relationship to the other people in the
            world; vital connections which you have for the time being severed.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I am particularly glad to express my admiration for
            the kind of organization which you have drawn together. I have
            attended banquets of chambers of commerce in various parts of the
            country and have got the impression at each of those banquets that
            there was only one city in the country. It has seemed to me that
            those associations were meant in order to destroy men’s perspective,
            in order to destroy their sense of relative proportions. Worst of
            all, if I may be permitted to say so, they were intended to boost
            something in particular. Boosting is a very unhandsome thing.
            Advancing enterprise is a very handsome thing, but to exaggerate
            local merits in order to create disproportion in the general
            development is not a particularly handsome thing or a particularly
            intelligent thing. A city can not grow on the face of a great state
            like a mushroom on that one spot. Its roots are throughout the
            state, and unless the state it is in, or the region it draws from,
            can itself thrive and pulse with life as a whole, the city can have
            no healthy growth. You forget the wide rootages of everything when
            you boost some particular region. There are dangers which probably
            you all understand in the mere practice of advertisement. When a man
            begins to advertise himself there are certain points that are
            somewhat exaggerated, and I have noticed that men who exaggerate
            most, most quickly lose any proper conception of what their own
            proportions are. Therefore, these local centers of enthusiasm may be
            local centers of mistake if they are not very wisely guided and if
            they do not themselves realize their relations to the other centers
            of enthusiasm and of advancement.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The advantage about a Chamber of Commerce of the
            United States is that there is only one way to boost the
               <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place>, and that is by seeing to it that
            the conditions under which business is done throughout the whole
            country are the best possible conditions. There can not be any
            disproportion about that. If you draw your sap and your vitality
            from all quarters, then the more sap and vitality there is in you
            the more there is in the commonwealth as a whole, and every time you
            lift at all you lift the whole level of manufacturing and mercantile
            enterprise. Moreover, the advantage of it is that you cannot boost
            the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> in that way without understanding
            the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place>. You learn a great deal. I agreed
            with a colleague of mine in the Cabinet the other day that we had
            never attended in our lives before a school to compare with that we
            were now attending for the purpose of gaining a liberal education.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Of course, I learn a great many things that are not
            so, but the interesting thing about that is this: Things that are
            not so do not match. If you hear enough of them, you see there is no
            pattern whatever; it is a crazy quilt. Whereas, the truth always
            matches, piece by piece, with other parts of the truth. No man can
            lie consistently, and he cannot lie about everything if he talks to
            you long. I would guarantee that if enough liars talked to you, you
            would get the truth; because the parts that they did not invent
            would match one another, and the parts that they did invent would
               <render as="italic" rend="inherit">not</render> match one another. Talk long
            enough, therefore, and see the connections clearly enough, and you
            can patch together the case as a whole. I had somewhat that
            experience about <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Mexico</place>, and that was about the only
            way in which I learned anything that was true about it. For there
            had been vivid imaginations and many special interests which
            depicted things as they wished me to believe them to be.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Seriously, the task of this body is to match all the
            facts of business throughout the country and to see the vast and
            consistent pattern of it. That is the reason I think you are to be
            congratulated upon the fact that you cannot do this thing without
            common counsel. There isn’t any man who knows enough to comprehend
            the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place>. It is a cooperative effort,
            necessarily. You cannot perform the functions of this Chamber of
            Commerce without drawing in not only a vast number of men, but men,
            and a number of men, from every region and section of the country.
            The minute this association falls into the hands, if it ever should,
            of men from a single section or men with a single set of interests
            most at heart, it will go to seed and die. Its strength must come
            from the uttermost parts of the land and must be compounded of
            brains and comprehensions of every sort. It is a very noble and
            handsome picture for the imagination, and I have asked myself before
            I came here <word altform="today">to-day</word>, what relation you
            could bear to the Government of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> and
            what relation the Government could bear to you?</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">There are two aspects and activities of the Government
            with which you will naturally come into most direct contact. The
            first is the Government’s power of inquiry, systematic and
            disinterested inquiry, and its power of scientific assistance. You
            get an illustration of the latter, for example, in the Department of
            Agriculture. Has it occurred to you, I wonder, that we are just upon
            the eve of a time when our Department of Agriculture will be of
            infinite importance to the whole world? There is a shortage of food
            in the world now. That shortage will be much more serious a few
            months from now than it is now. It is necessary that we should plant
            a great deal more; it is necessary that our lands should yield more
            per acre than they do now; it is necessary that there should not be
            a plow or a spade idle in this country if the world is to be fed.
            And the methods of our farmers must feed upon the scientific
            information to be derived from the State departments of agriculture,
            and from that taproot of all, the United States Department of
            Agriculture. The object and use of that department is to inform men
            of the latest developments and disclosures of science with regard to
            all the processes by which soils can be put to their proper use and
            their fertility made the greatest possible. Similarly with the
            Bureau of Standards. It is ready to supply those things by which you
            can set norms, you can set bases, for all the scientific processes
            of business.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I have a great admiration for the scientific parts of
            the Government of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place>, and it has
            amazed me that so few men have discovered them. Here in these
            departments are quiet men, trained to the highest degree of skill,
            serving for a petty renumeration along lines that are infinitely
            useful to mankind; and yet in some cases they waited to be
            discovered until this Chamber of Commerce of the United States was
            established. Coming to this city, officers of that association found
            that there were here things that were infinitely useful to them and
            with which the whole <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> ought to be put
            into communication.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The Government of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> is
            very properly a great instrumentality of inquiry and information.
            One thing we are just beginning to do that we ought to have done
            long ago: We ought long ago to have had our Bureau of Foreign and
            Domestic Commerce. We ought long ago to have sent the best eyes of
            the Government out into the world to see where the opportunities and
            openings of American commerce and American genius were to be
            found—men who were not sent out as the commercial agents of any
            particular set of business men in the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place>,
            but who were eyes for the whole business community. I have been
            reading consular reports for 20 years. In what I came to regard as
            an evil day the Congressman from my district began to send me the
            consular reports, and they ate up more and more of my time. They are
            very interesting, but they are a good deal like what the old lady
            said of the dictionary, that it was very interesting but a little
            disconnected. You get a picture of the world as if a spotlight were
            being dotted about over the surface of it. Here you see a glimpse of
            this, and here you see a glimpse of that, and through the medium of
            some consuls you do not see anything at all. Because the consul has
            to have eyes and the consul has to know what he is looking for. A
            literary friend of mine said that he used to believe in the maxim
            that “everything comes to the man who waits,” but he discovered
            after awhile by practical experience that it needed an additional
            clause, “provided he knows what he is waiting for.” Unless you know
            what you are looking for and have trained eyes to see it when it
            comes your way, it may pass you unnoticed. We are just beginning to
            do, systematically and scientifically, what we ought long ago to
            have done, to employ the Government of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United
            States</place> to survey the world in order that American commerce
            might be guided.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">But there are other ways of using the Government of
            the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place>, ways that have long been tried,
            though not always with conspicuous success or fortunate results. You
            can use the Government of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> by
            influencing its legislation. That has been a very active industry,
            but it has not always been managed in the interest of the whole
            people. It is very instructive and useful for the Government of the
               <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> to have such means as you are ready
            to supply for getting a sort of consensus of opinion which proceeds
            from no particular quarter and originates with no particular
            interest. Information is the very foundation of all right action in
            legislation.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I remember once, a good many years ago, I was
            attending one of the local chambers of commerce of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United
               States</place> at a time when everybody was complaining that
            Congress was interfering with business. If you have heard that
            complaint recently and supposed that it was original with the men
            who made it, you have not lived as long as I have. It has been going
            on ever since I can remember. The complaint came most vigorously
            from men who were interested in large corporate development. I took
            the liberty to say to that body of men, whom I did not know, that I
            took it for granted that there were a great many lawyers among them,
            and that it was likely that the more prominent of those lawyers were
            the intimate advisors of the corporations of that region. I said
            that I had met a great many lawyers from whom the complaint had come
            most vigorously, not only that there was too much legislation with
            regard to corporations, but that it was ignorant legislation. I
            said, “Now, the responsibility is with you. If the legislation is
            mistaken, you are on the inside and know where the mistakes are
            being made. You know not only the innocent and right things that
            your corporations are doing, but you know the other things, too.
            Knowing how they are done, you can be expert advisors as to how the
            wrong things can be prevented. If, therefore, this thing is handled
            ignorantly, there is nobody to blame but yourselves.” If we on the
            outside cannot understand the thing and cannot get advice from the
            inside, then we will have to do it with the flat hand and not with
            the touch of skill and discrimination. Isn’t that true? Men on the
            inside of business know how business is conducted and they cannot
            complain if men on the outside make mistakes about business if they
            do not come from the inside and give the kind of advice which is
            necessary.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The trouble has been that when they came in the
            past—for I think the thing is changing very rapidly—they came with
            all their bristles out; they came on the defensive; they came to
            see, not what they could accomplish, but what they could prevent.
            They did not come to guide; they came to block. That is of no use
            whatever to the general body politic. What has got to pervade us
            like a great motive power is that we cannot, and must not, separate
            our interests from one another, but must pool our interests. A man
            who is trying to fight for his single hand is fighting against the
            community and not fighting with it. There are a great many dreadful
            things about war, as nobody needs to be told in this <word altform="World War I">day of distress and of terror</word>, but
            there is one thing about war which has a very splendid side, and
            that is the consciousness that a whole nation gets that they must
            all act as a unit for a common end. And when peace is as handsome as
            war there will be no war. When men, I mean, engage in the pursuits
            of peace in the same spirit of self-sacrifice and of conscious
            service of the community with which, at any rate, the common soldier
            engages in war, then shall there be wars no more. You have moved the
            vanguard for the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> in the purposes of
            this association just a little nearer that ideal. That is the reason
            I am here, because I believe it.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">There is a specific matter about which I, for one,
            want your advice. Let me say, if I may say it without disrespect,
            that I do not think you are prepared to give it right away. You will
            have to make some rather extended inquiries before you are ready to
            give it. What I am thinking of is competition in foreign markets as
            between the merchants of different nations.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I speak of the subject with a certain degree of
            hesitation, because the thing farthest from my thought is taking
            advantage of nations now disabled from playing their full part in
            that competition, and seeking a sudden selfish advantage because
            they are for the time being disabled. Pray believe me that we ought
            to eliminate all that thought from our minds and consider this
            matter as if we and the other nations now at war were in the normal
            circumstances of commerce.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">There is a normal circumstance of commerce in which we
            are apparently at a disadvantage. Our anti-trust laws are thought by
            some to make it illegal for merchants in the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United
            States</place> to form combinations for the purpose of strengthening
            themselves in taking advantage of the opportunities of foreign
            trade. That is a very serious matter for this reason: There are some
            corporations, and some firms for all I know, whose business is great
            enough and whose resources are abundant enough to enable them to
            establish selling agencies in foreign countries; to enable them to
            extend the long credits which in some cases are necessary in order
            to keep the trade they desire; to enable them, in other words, to
            organize their business in foreign territory in a way which the
            smaller man cannot afford to do. His business has not grown big
            enough to permit him to establish selling agencies. The export
            commission merchant, perhaps, taxes him a little too highly to make
            that an available competitive means of conducting and extending his
            business.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The question arises, therefore, how are the smaller
            merchants, how are the younger and weaker corporations going to get
            a foothold as against the combinations which are permitted and even
            encouraged by foreign governments in this field of competition?
            There are governments which, as you know, distinctly encourage the
            formation of great combinations in each particular field of commerce
            in order to maintain selling agencies and to extend long credits,
            and to use and maintain the machinery which is necessary for the
            extension of business; and American merchants feel that they are at
            a very considerable disadvantage in contending against that. The
            matter has been many times brought to my attention, and I have each
            time suspended judgment. I want to be shown this: I want to be shown
            how such a combination can be made and conducted in a way which will
            not close it against the use of everybody who wants to use it. A
            combination has a tendency to exclude new members. When a group of
            men get control of a good thing, they do not see any particular
            point in letting other people into the good thing. What I would like
            very much to be shown, therefore, is a method of cooperation which
            is not a method of combination. Not that the two words are mutually
            exclusive, but we have come to have a special meaning attached to
            the word “combination.” Most of our combinations have a safety lock,
            and you have to know the combination to get in. I want to know how
            these cooperative methods can be adopted for the benefit of
            everybody who wants to use them, and I say frankly if I can be shown
            that, I am for them. If I can not be shown that, I am against them.
            I hasten to add that I hopefully expect I <render as="italic" rend="inherit">can</render> be shown that.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">You, as I have just now intimated, probably can not
            show it to me off-hand, but by the methods which you have the means
            of using you certainly ought to be able to throw a vast deal of
            light on the subject. Because the minute you ask the small merchant,
            the small banker, the country man, how he looks upon these things
            and how he thinks they ought to be arranged in order that he can use
            them, if he is like some of the men in country districts whom I
            know, he will turn out to have had a good deal of thought upon that
            subject and to be able to make some very interesting suggestions
            whose intelligence and comprehensiveness will surprise some city
            gentlemen who think that only the cities understand the business of
            the country. As a matter of fact, you do not have time to think in a
            city. It takes time to think. You can get what you call opinions by
            contagion in a city and get them very quickly, but you do not always
            know where the germ came from. And you have no scientific laboratory
            method by which to determine whether it is a good germ or a bad
            germ.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">There are thinking spaces in this country, and some of
            the thinking done is very solid thinking indeed, the thinking of the
            sort of men that we all love best, who think for themselves, who do
            not see things as they are told to see them, but look at them and
            see them independently; who, if they are told they are white when
            they are black, plainly say that they are black—men with eyes and
            with a courage back of those eyes to tell what they see. The country
            is full of those men. They have been singularly reticent sometimes,
            singularly silent, but the country is full of them. And what I
            rejoice in is that you have called them into the ranks. For your
            methods are bound to be democratic in spite of you. I do not mean
            democratic with a big “D,” though I have a private conviction that
            you cannot be democratic with a small “d” long without becoming
            democratic with a big “D.” Still that is just between ourselves. The
            point is that when we have a <render as="italic" rend="inherit">consensus</render>
            of opinion, when we have this common counsel, then the legislative
            processes of this Government will be infinitely illuminated.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I used to wonder when I was Governor of <placeRef reg="New Jersey" link-pointer-type="place">one of the States</placeRef> of this great
            country where all the bills came from. Some of them had a very
            private complexion. I found upon inquiry—it was easy to find—that
            practically nine-tenths of the bills that were introduced had been
            handed to the members who introduced them by some constituent of
            theirs, had been drawn up by some lawyer whom they might or might
            not know, and were intended to do something that would be beneficial
            to a particular set of persons. I do not mean, necessarily,
            beneficial in a way that would be hurtful to the rest; they may have
            been perfectly honest, but they came out of cubby-holes all over the
            State. They did not come out of public places where men had got
            together and compared views. They were not the products of common
            counsel, but the products of private counsel, a very necessary
            process if there is no other, but a process which it would be a very
            happy thing to dispense with if we could get another. And the only
            other process is the process of common counsel.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Some of the happiest experiences of my life have been
            like this. We had once when I was president of <place reg="Princeton University" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">a university</place> to revise the
            whole course of study. Courses of study are chronically in need of
            revision. A committee of, I believe, 14 men was directed by the
            faculty of the university to report a revised curriculum. Naturally,
            the men who had the most ideas on the subject were picked out and,
            naturally, each man came with a very definite notion of the kind of
            revision he wanted, and one of the first discoveries we made was
            that no two of us wanted exactly the same revision. I went in there
            with all my war paint on to get the revision I wanted, and I dare
            say, though it was perhaps more skillfully concealed, the other men
            had their war paint on, too. We discussed the matter for six months.
            The result was a report which no one of us had conceived or
            foreseen, but with which we were all absolutely satisfied. There was
            not a man who had not learned in that committee more than he had
            ever known before about the subject, and who had not willingly
            revised his prepossessions; who was not proud to be a participant in
            a genuine piece of common counsel. I have had several experiences of
            that sort, and it has led me, whenever I confer, to hold my
            particular opinion provisionally, as my contribution to go into the
            final result but not to dominate the final result.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">That is the ideal of a government like ours, and an
            interesting thing is that if you only talk about an idea that will
            not work long enough, everybody will see perfectly plainly that it
            will not work; whereas, if you do not talk about it, and do not have
            a great many people talk about it, you are in danger of having the
            people who handle it think that it will work. Many minds are
            necessary to compound a workable method of life in a various and
            populous country; and as I think about the whole thing and picture
            the purposes, the infinitely difficult and complex purposes which we
            must conceive and carry out, not only does it minister to my own
            modesty, I hope, of opinion, but it also fills me with a very great
            enthusiasm. It is a splendid thing to be part of a great wide-awake
            Nation. It is a splendid thing to know that your own strength is
            infinitely multiplied by the strength of other men who love the
            country as you do. It is a splendid thing to feel that the wholesome
            blood of a great country can be united in common purposes, and that
            by frankly looking one another in the face and taking counsel with
            one another, prejudices will drop away, handsome understandings will
            arise, a universal spirit of service will be engendered, and that
            with this increased sense of community of purpose will come a vastly
            enhanced individual power of achievement; for we will be lifted by
            the whole mass of which we constituto a part.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Have you never heard a great chorus of trained voices
            lift the voice of the prima donna as if it soared with easy grace
            above the whole melodious sound? It does not seem to come from the
            single throat that produces it. It seems as if it were the perfect
            accent and crown of the great chorus. So it ought to be with the
            statesman. So it ought to be with every man who tries to guide the
            counsels of a great nation. He should feel that his voice is lifted
            upon the chorus and that it is only the crown of the common
         theme.</p>

         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Mr. <render as="smallcap" rend="inherit">President, Gentlemen of the
               Associated Press, Ladies, and Gentlemen</render>: I am deeply
            gratified by the generous reception you have accorded me. It makes
            me look back with a touch of regret to former occasions when I have
            stood in this place and enjoyed a greater liberty than is granted me
               <word altform="today">to-day</word>. There have been times when I
            stood in this spot and said what I really thought, and I can not
            help praying that those days of indulgence may be accorded me again.
            I have come here <word altform="today">to-day</word>, of course,
            somewhat restrained by a sense of responsibility which I can not
            escape. For I take the Associated Press very seriously. I know the
            enormous part that you play in the affairs not only of this country
            but of the world. You deal in the raw material of opinion and, if my
            convictions have any validity, opinion ultimately governs the world.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">It is, therefore, of very serious things that I think
            as I face this body of men. I do not think of you, however, as
            members of the Associated Press. I do not think of you as men of
            different parties or of different racial derivations or of different
            religious denominations. I want to talk to you as to my fellow
            citizens of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place>, for there are serious
            things which as fellow citizens we ought to consider. The times
            behind us, gentlemen, have been difficult enough; the times before
            us are likely to be more difficult still, because, whatever may be
            said about the present condition of the world’s affairs, it is clear
            that they are drawing rapidly to a climax, and at the climax the
            test will come, not only for the nations engaged in the present
            colossal struggle—it will come to them, of course—but the test will
            come for us particularly.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Do you realize that, roughly speaking, we are the only
            great Nation at present disengaged? I am not speaking, of course,
            with disparagement of the greatness of those nations in
               <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Europe</place> which are not parties to <word altform="World War I">the present war</word>, but I am thinking
            of their close neighborhood to it. I am thinking how their lives
            much more than ours touch the very heart and stuff of the business,
            whereas we have rolling between us and those bitter days across the
            water 3,000 miles of cool and silent ocean. Our atmosphere is not
            yet charged with those disturbing elements which must permeate every
            nation of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Europe</place>. Therefore, is it not likely that
            the nations of the world will some day turn to us for the cooler
            assessment of the elements engaged? I am not now thinking so
            preposterous a thought as that we should sit in judgment upon
            them—no nation is fit to sit in judgment upon any other nation—but
            that we shall some day have to assist in reconstructing the
            processes of peace. Our resources are untouched; we are more and
            more becoming by the force of circumstances the mediating Nation of
            the world in respect of its finance. We must make up our minds what
            are the best things to do and what are the best ways to do them. We
            must put our money, our energy, our enthusiasm, our sympathy into
            these things, and we must have our judgments prepared and our
            spirits chastened against the coming of that day.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">So that I am not speaking in a selfish spirit when I
            say that our whole duty, for the present at any rate, is summed up
            in this motto, “<place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> first.” Let us think of
               <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> before we think of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Europe</place>,
            in order that <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> may be fit to be
               <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Europe’s</place> friend when the day of tested friendship
            comes. The test of friendship is not now sympathy with the one side
            or the other, but getting ready to help both sides when the struggle
            is over. The basis of neutrality, gentlemen, is not indifference; it
            is not self-interest. The basis of neutrality is sympathy for
            mankind. It is fairness, it is good will, at bottom. It is
            impartiality of spirit and of judgment. I wish that all of our
            fellow citizens could realize that. There is in some quarters a
            disposition to create distempers in this body politic. Men are even
            uttering slanders against the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place>, as if to
            excite her. Men are saying that if we should go to war upon either
            side there would be a divided <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place>—an abominable
            libel of ignorance! <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> is not all of it vocal
            just now. It is vocal in spots, but I, for one, have a complete and
            abiding faith in that great silent body of Americans who are not
            standing up and shouting and expressing their opinions just now, but
            are waiting to find out and support the duty of
            <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place>. I am just as sure of their solidity and of
            their loyalty and of their unanimity, if we act justly, as I am that
            the history of this country has at every crisis and turning point
            illustrated this great lesson.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">We are the mediating Nation of the world. I do not
            mean that we undertake not to mind our own business and to mediate
            where other people are quarreling. I mean the word in a broader
            sense. We are compounded of the nations of the world; we mediate
            their blood, we mediate their traditions, we mediate their
            sentiments, their tastes, their passions; we are ourselves
            compounded of those things. We are, therefore, able to understand
            all nations; we are able to understand them in the compound, not
            separately, as partisans, but unitedly as knowing and comprehending
            and embodying them all. It is in that sense that I mean that
               <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> is a mediating Nation. The opinion of
               <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place>, the action of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place>, is
            ready to turn, and free to turn, in any direction. Did you ever
            reflect upon how almost every other nation has through long
            centuries been headed in one direction? That is not true of the
               <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place>. The <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place>
            has no racial momentum. It has no history back of it which makes it
            run all its energies and all its ambitions in one particular
            direction. And <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> is particularly free in this,
            that she has no hampering ambitions as a world power. We do not want
            a foot of anybody’s territory. If we have been obliged by
            circumstances, or have considered ourselves to be obliged by
            circumstances, in the past, to take territory which we otherwise
            would not have thought of taking, I believe I am right in saying
            that we have considered it our duty to administer that territory,
            not for ourselves but for the people living in it, and to put this
            burden upon our consciences—not to think that this thing is ours for
            our use, but to regard ourselves as trustees of the great business
            for those to whom it does really belong, trustees ready to hand it
            over to the <foreign lang="Latin">cestui que</foreign> trust<ref refurl="spe98044819150420335_1" link-pointer-type="Note"/> at any
            time when the business seems to make that possible and feasible.
            That is what I mean by saying we have no hampering ambitions. We do
            not want anything that does not belong to us. Is not a nation in
            that position free to serve other nations, and is not a nation like
            that ready to form some part of the assessing opinion of the world?</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">My interest in the neutrality of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United
               States</place> is not the petty desire to keep out of trouble. To
            judge by my experience, I have never been able to keep out of
            trouble. I have never looked for it, but I have always found it. I
            do not want to walk around trouble. If any man wants a scrap that is
            an interesting scrap and worth while, I am his man. I warn him that
            he is not going to draw me into the scrap for his advertisement, but
            if he is looking for trouble that is the trouble of men in general
            and I can help a little, why, then, I am in for it. But I am
            interested in neutrality because there is something so much greater
            to do than fight; there is a distinction waiting for this Nation
            that no nation has ever yet got. That is the distinction of absolute
            self-control and self-mastery. Whom do you admire most among your
            friends? The irritable man? The man out of whom you can get a “rise”
            without trying? The man who will fight at the drop of the hat,
            whether he knows what the hat is dropped for or not? Don’t you
            admire and don’t you fear, if you have to contest with him, the
            self-mastered man who watches you with calm eye and comes in only
            when you have carried the thing so far that you must be disposed of?
            That is the man you respect. That is the man who, you know, has at
            bottom a much more fundamental and terrible courage than the
            irritable, fighting man. Now, I covet for <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place>
            this splendid courage of reserve moral force, and I wanted to point
            out to you gentlemen simply this:</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">There is news and news. There is what is called news
            from <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Turtle Bay</place> that turns out to be falsehood, at
            any rate in what it is said to signify, but which, if you could get
            the Nation to believe it true, might disturb our equilibrium and our
            self-possession. We ought not to deal in stuff of that kind. We
            ought not to permit that sort of thing to use up the electrical
            energy of the wires, because its energy is malign, its energy is not
            of the truth, its energy is of mischief. It is possible to sift
            truth. I have known some things to go out on the wires as true when
            there was only one man or one group of men who could have told the
            originators of that report whether it was true or not and they were
            not asked whether it was true or not for fear it might not be true.
            That sort of report ought not to go out over the wires. There is
            generally, if not always, somebody who knows whether the thing is so
            or not, and in these days, above all over days, we ought to take
            particular pains to resort to the one small group of men, or to the
            one man if there be but one, who knows whether those things are true
            or not. The world ought to know the truth; the world ought not at
            this period of unstable equilibrium to be disturbed by rumor, ought
            not to be disturbed by imaginative combinations of circumstances,
            or, rather, by circumstances stated in combination which do not
            belong in combination. You gentlemen, and gentlemen engaged like
            you, are holding the balances in your hand. This unstable
            equilibrium rests upon scales that are in your hands. For the food
            of opinion, as I began by saying, is the news of the day. I have
            known many a man to go off at a tangent on information that was not
            reliable. Indeed, that describes the majority of men. The world is
            held stable by the man who waits for the next day to find out
            whether the report was true or not.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">We can not afford, therefore, to let the rumors of
            irresponsible persons and origins get into the atmosphere of the
               <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place>. We are trustees for what I venture
            to say is the greatest heritage that any nation ever had, the love
            of justice and righteousness and human liberty. For, fundamentally,
            those are the things to which <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> is addicted and
            to which she is devoted. There are groups of selfish men in the
               <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place>, there are coteries, where sinister
            things are purposed, but the great heart of the American people is
            just as sound and true as it ever was. And it is a single heart; it
            is the heart of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place>. It is not a heart made up of
            sections selected out of other countries.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">What I try to remind myself of every day when I am
            almost overcome by perplexities, what I try to remember, is what the
            people at home are thinking about. I try to put myself in the place
            of the man who does not know all the things that I know and ask
            myself what he would like the policy of this country to be. Not the
            talkative man, not the partisan man, not the man who remembers first
            that he is a Republican or a Democrat, or that his parents were
            German or English, but the man who remembers first that the whole
            destiny of modern affairs centers largely upon his being an American
            first of all. If I permitted myself to be a partisan in this present
            struggle, I would be unworthy to represent you. If I permitted
            myself to forget the people who are not partisans, I would be
            unworthy to be your spokesman. I am not sure that I am worthy to
            represent you, but I do claim this degree of worthiness—that before
            everything else I love <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place>.</p>

         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve"><render as="smallcap" rend="inherit">Mr. Mayor, Fellow
            Citizens</render>: It warms my heart that you should give me such a
            reception; but it is not of myself that I wish to think to-night,
            but of those who have just become citizens of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United
               States</place>.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">This is the only country in the world which
            experiences this constant and repeated rebirth. Other countries
            depend upon the multiplication of their own native people. This
            country is constantly drinking strength out of new sources by the
            voluntary association with it of great bodies of strong men and
            forward-looking women out of other lands. And so by the gift of the
            free will of independent people it is being constantly renewed from
            generation to generation by the same process by which it was
            originally created. It is as if humanity had determined to see to it
            that this great Nation, founded for the benefit of humanity, should
            not lack for the allegiance of the people of the world.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">You have just taken an oath of allegiance to the
               <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place>. Of allegiance to whom? Of
            allegiance to no one, unless it be God—certainly not of allegiance
            to those who temporarily represent this great Government. You have
            taken an oath of allegiance to a great ideal, to a great body of
            principles, to a great hope of the human race. You have said, “We
            are going to <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> not only to earn a living, not
            only to seek the things which it was more difficult to obtain where
            we were born, but to help forward the great enterprises of the human
            spirit—to let men know that everywhere in the world there are men
            who will cross strange oceans and go where a speech is spoken which
            is alien to them if they can but satisfy their quest for what their
            spirits crave; knowing that whatever the speech there is but one
            longing and utterance of the human heart, and that is for liberty
            and justice.” And while you bring all countries with you, you come
            with a purpose of leaving all other countries behind you—bringing
            what is best of their spirit, but not looking over your shoulders
            and seeking to perpetuate what you intended to leave behind in them.
            I certainly would not be one even to suggest that a man cease to
            love the home of his birth and the nation of his origin—these things
            are very sacred and ought not to be put out of our hearts—but it is
            one thing to love the place where you were born and it is another
            thing to dedicate yourself to the place to which you go. You can not
            dedicate yourself to <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> unless you become in
            every respect and with every purpose of your will thorough
            Americans. You can not become thorough Americans if you think of
            yourselves in groups. <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> does not consist of
            groups. A man who thinks of himself as belonging to a particular
            national group in <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> has not yet become an
            American, and the man who goes among you to trade upon your
            nationality is no worthy son to live under the Stars and Stripes.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">My urgent advice to you would be, not only always to
            think first of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place>, but always, also, to think
            first of humanity. You do not love humanity if you seek to divide
            humanity into jealous camps. Humanity can be welded together only by
            love, by sympathy, by justice, not by jealousy and hatred. I am
            sorry for the man who seeks to make personal capital out of the
            passions of his fellow-men. He has lost the touch and ideal of
               <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place>, for <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> was created to
            unite mankind by those passions which lift and not by the passions
            which separate and debase. We came to <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place>, either
            ourselves or in the persons of our ancestors, to better the ideals
            of men, to make them see finer things than they had seen before, to
            get rid of the things that divide and to make sure of the things
            that unite. It was but an historical accident no doubt that this
            great country was called the “<place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place>”; yet I
            am very thankful that it has that word “United” in its title, and
            the man who seeks to divide man from man, group from group, interest
            from interest in this great Union is striking at its very heart.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">It is a very interesting circumstance to me, in
            thinking of those of you who have just sworn allegiance to this
            great Government, that you were drawn across the ocean by some
            beckoning finger of hope, by some belief, by some vision of a new
            kind of justice, by some expectation of a better kind of life. No
            doubt you have been disappointed in some of us. Some of us are very
            disappointing. No doubt you have found that justice in the
               <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> goes only with a pure heart and a
            right purpose as it does everywhere else in the world. No doubt what
            you found here did not seem touched for you, after all, with the
            complete beauty of the ideal which you had conceived beforehand. But
            remember this: If we had grown at all poor in the ideal, you brought
            some of it with you. A man does not go out to seek the thing that is
            not in him. A man does not hope for the thing that he does not
            believe in, and if some of us have forgotten what
            <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> believed in, you, at any rate, imported in
            your own hearts a renewal of the belief. That is the reason that I,
            for one, make you welcome. If I have in any degree forgotten what
               <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> was intended for, I will thank God if you
            will remind me. I was born in <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place>. You dreamed
            dreams of what <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> was to be, and I hope you
            brought the dreams with you. No man that does not see visions will
            ever realize any high hope or undertake any high enterprise. Just
            because you brought dreams with you, <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> is more
            likely to realize dreams such as you brought. You are enriching us
            if you came expecting us to be better than we are.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">See, my friends, what that means. It means that
            Americans must have a consciousness different from the consciousness
            of every other nation in the world. I am not saying this with even
            the slightest thought of criticism of other nations. You know how it
            is with a family. A family gets centered on itself if it is not
            careful and is less interested in the neighbors than it is in its
            own members. So a nation that is not constantly renewed out of new
            sources is apt to have the narrowness and prejudice of a family;
            whereas, <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> must have this consciousness, that
            on all sides it touches elbows and touches hearts with all the
            nations of mankind. The example of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> must be a
            special example. The example of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> must be the
            example not merely of peace because it will not fight, but of peace
            because peace is the healing and elevating influence of the world
            and strife is not. There is such a thing as a man being too proud to
            fight. There is such a thing as a nation being so right that it does
            not need to convince others by force that it is right.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">You have come into this great National voluntarily
            seeking something that we have to give, and all that we have to give
            is this: We can not exempt you from work. No man is exempt from work
            anywhere in the world. We can not exempt you from the strife and the
            heartbreaking burden of the struggle of the day—that is common to
            mankind everywhere; we can not exempt you from the loads that you
            must carry. We can only make them light by the spirit in which they
            are carried. That is the spirit of hope, it is the spirit of
            liberty, it is the spirit of justice.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">When I was asked, therefore, by the Mayor and the
            committee that accompanied him to come up from <place reg="Washington, DC" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Washington</place> to meet this great
            company of newly admitted citizens, I could not decline the
            invitation. I ought not to be away from <place reg="Washington, DC" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Washington</place>, and yet I feel that it has renewed my spirit
            as an American to be here. In <place reg="Washington, DC" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Washington</place> men tell you so many things every day that are
            not so, and I like to come and stand in the presence of a great body
            of my fellow-citizens, whether they have been my fellow-citizens a
            long time or a short time, and drink, as it were, out of the common
            fountains with them and go back feeling what you have so generously
            given me—the sense of your support and of the living vitality in
            your hearts of the great ideals which have made
            <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> the hope of the world.</p>

                  <person link-pointer-type="person">Admiral Fletcher</person>, and Gentlemen of the
            Fleet</render>: This is not an occasion upon which, it seems to me,
            it would be wise for me to make many remarks, but I would deprive
            myself of a great gratification if I did not express my pleasure in
            being here, my gratitude for the splendid reception which has been
            accorded me as the representative of the Nation, and my profound
            interest in the Navy of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place>. That is an
            interest with which I was apparently born, for it began when I was a
            youngster and has ripened with my knowledge of the affairs and
            policies of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place>.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I think it is a natural, instinctive judgment of the
            people of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> that they express their
            power most appropriately in an efficient navy, and their interest in
            their ships is partly, I believe, because that Navy is expected to
            express their character, not within our own borders where that
            character is understood, but outside our borders where it is hoped
            we may occasionally touch others with some slight vision of what
               <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> stands for.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Before I speak of the Navy of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United
            States</place>, I want to take advantage of the first public
            opportunity I have had to speak of the Secretary of the Navy, to
            express my confidence and my admiration, and to say that he has my
            unqualified support. For I have counseled with him in intimate
            fashion; I know how sincerely he has it at heart that everything
            that the Navy does and handles should be done and handled as the
            people of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> wish it handled.
            Efficiency is something more than organization. Efficiency runs to
            the extent of lifting the ideals of a service above every personal
            interest. So when I speak my support of the <personRef refurl="x4005046" reg="Josephus Daniels" link-pointer-type="person">Secretary of the Navy</personRef> I am
            merely speaking my support of what I know every true lover of the
            Navy to desire and to purpose; for the Navy of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United
               States</place> is, as I have said, a body specially entrusted
            with the ideals of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place>.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I like to image in my thought this idea: These quiet
            ships lying in the river have no suggestion of bluster about them,
            no intimation of aggression. They are commanded by men thoughtful of
            the duty of citizens as well as the duty of officers, men acquainted
            with the traditions of the great service to which they belong, men
            who know by touch with the people of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United
            States</place> what sort of purposes they ought to entertain and
            what sort of discretion they ought to exercise in order to use those
            engines of force as engines to promote the interests of humanity.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The interesting and inspiring thing about
               <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place>, gentlemen, is that she asks nothing for
            herself except what she has a right to ask for humanity itself. We
            want no nation’s property. We mean to question no nation’s honor. We
            do not wish to stand selfishly in the way of the development of any
            nation. We want nothing that we cannot get by our own legitimate
            enterprise and by the inspiration of our own example; and, standing
            for these things, it is not pretension on our part to say that we
            are privileged to stand for what every nation would wish to stand
            for, and speak for those things which all humanity must desire.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">When I think of the flag which those ships carry, the
            only touch of color about them, the only thing that moves as if it
            had a subtle spirit in it in their solid structure, it seems to me
            that I see alternate strips of parchment upon which are written the
            rights of liberty and justice, and stripes of blood spilt to
            vindicate those rights; and, then, in the corner a prediction of the
            blue serene into which every nation may swim which stands for these
            things.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The mission of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> is the only
            thing that a sailor or a soldier should think about. He has nothing
            to do with the formulation of her policy. He is to support her
            policy whatever it is; but he is to support her policy in the spirit
            of herself, and the strength of our polity is that we who for the
            time being administer the affairs of this Nation do not originate
            her spirit. We attempt to embody it; we attempt to realize it in
            action; we are dominated by it, we do not dictate it.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">So with every man in arms who serves the Nation; he
            stands and waits to do the thing which the Nation desires. Those who
            represent <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> sometimes seem to forget her
            programmes, but the people never forget them. It is as startling as
            it is touching to see how whenever you touch a principle you touch
            the hearts of the people of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place>. They
            listen to your debates of policy, they determine which party they
            will prefer to power, they choose and prefer as between men, but
            their real affection, their real force, their real irresistible
            momentum is for the ideas which men embody. I never go on the
            streets of a great city without feeling that somehow I do not confer
            elsewhere than on the streets with the great spirit of the people
            themselves, going about their business, attending to the things
            which immediately concern them, and yet carrying a treasure at their
            hearts all the while, ready to be stirred not only as individuals
            but as members of a great union of hearts that constitutes a
            patriotic people. This sight in the river touches me merely as a
            symbol of all this; and it quickens the pulse of every man who
            realizes these things to have anything to do with them. When a
            crisis occurs in this country, gentlemen, it is as if you put your
            hand on the pulse of a dynamo, it is as if the things that you were
            in connection with were spiritually bred, as if you had nothing to
            do with them except, if you listen truly, to speak the things that
            you hear.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">These things now brood over the river; this spirit now
            moves with the men who represent the Nation in the Navy; these
            things will move upon the waters in the maneuvers—no threat lifted
            against any man, against any nation, against any interest, but just
            a great solemn evidence that the force of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> is
            the force of moral principle, that there is nothing else that she
            loves, and that there is nothing else for which she will contend.</p>

            <render as="smallcap" rend="inherit">Mr. Chairman, Gentlemen of the American
               Republics, Ladies and Gentlemen:</render>
         </p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The part that falls to me this morning is a very
            simple one, but a very delightful one. It is to bid you a very
            hearty welcome indeed to this conference. The welcome is the more
            hearty because we are convinced that a conference like this will
            result in the things that we most desire. I am sure that those who
            have this conference in charge have already made plain to you its
            purpose and its spirit. Its purpose is to draw the American
            Republics together by bonds of common interest and of mutual
            understanding; and we comprehend, I hope, just what the meaning of
            that is. There can be no sort of union of interest if there is a
            purpose of exploitation by any one of the parties to a great
            conference of this sort. The basis of successful commercial
            intercourse is common interest, not selfish interest. It is an
            actual interchange of services and of values: it is based upon
            reciprocal relations and not selfish relations. It is based upon
            those things upon which all successful economic intercourse must be
            based, because selfishness breeds suspicion; suspicion, hostility;
            and hostility, failure. We are not, therefore, trying to make use of
            each other, but we are trying to be of use to one another.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">It is very surprising to me, it is even a source of
            mortification, that a conference like this should have been so long
            delayed, that it should never have occurred before, that it should
            have required <word altform="World War I">a crisis of the
            world</word> to show the Americas how truly they were neighbors to
            one another. If there is any one happy circumstance, gentlemen,
            arising out of the present distressing condition of the world, it is
            that it has revealed us to one another: it has shown us what it
            means to be neighbors. And I can not help harboring the hope, the
            very high hope, that by this commerce of minds with one another, as
            well as commerce in goods, we may show the world in part the path to
            peace. It would be a very great thing if the Americas could add to
            the distinction which they already wear this of showing the way to
            peace, to permanent peace.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The way to peace for us, at any rate, is manifest. It
            is the kind of rivalry which does not involve aggression. It is the
            knowledge that men can be of the greatest service to one another,
            and nations of the greatest service to one another, when the
            jealousy between them is merely a jealousy of excellence, and when
            the basis of their intercourse is friendship. There is only one way
            in which we wish to take advantage of you and that is by making
            better goods, by doing the things that we seek to do for each other
            better, if we can, than you do them, and so spurring you on, if we
            might, by so handsome a jealousy as that to excel us. I am so keenly
            aware that the basis of personal friendship is this competition in
            excellence, that I am perfectly certain that this is the only basis
            for the friendship of nations—this handsome rivalry, this rivalry in
            which there is no dislike, this rivalry in which there is nothing
            but the hope of a common elevation in great enterprises which we can
            undertake in common.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">There is one thing that stands in our way among
            others—for you are more conversant with the circumstances than I am.
            The thing I have chiefly in mind is the physical lack of means of
            communication—the lack of vehicles, the lack of ships, the lack of
            established routes of trade, the lack of those things which are
            absolutely necessary if we are to have true commercial and intimate
            commercial relations with one another—and I am perfectly clear in my
            judgment that if private capital can not soon enter upon the
            adventure of establishing these physical means of communication, the
            Government must undertake to do so. We can not indefinitely stand
            apart and need each other for the lack of what can easily be
            supplied, and if one instrumentality can not supply it, then another
            must be found which will supply it. We can not know each other
            unless we see each other; we can not deal with each other unless we
            communicate with each other. So soon as we communicate and are upon
            a familiar footing of intercourse, we shall understand one another,
            and the bonds between the Americas will be such bonds that no
            influence that the world may produce in the future will ever break
            them.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">If I am selfish for <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place>, I at least
            hope that my selfishness is enlightened. The selfishness that hurts
            the other party is not enlightened selfishness. If I were acting
            upon a mere ground of selfishness, I would seek to benefit the other
            party and so tie him to myself; so that even if you were to suspect
            me of selfishness, I hope you will also suspect me of intelligence
            and of knowing the only safe way for the establishment of the things
            which we covet, as well as the establishment of the things which we
            desire and which we would feel honored if we could earn and win.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I have said these things because they will perhaps
            enable you to understand how far from formal my welcome to this body
            is. It is a welcome from the heart; it is a welcome from the head;
            it is a welcome inspired by what I hope are the highest ambitions of
            those who live in these two great continents, who seek to set an
            example to the world in freedom of institutions, freedom of trade,
            and intelligence of mutual service.</p>

            behoove a nation to walk with its eyes over its shoulder. Its
            business is constantly in the years that lie ahead of it and in the
            present that challenges it to the display of its power. But there
            are reminiscences which are stimulating and wholesome, and among
            those reminiscences are chiefly to be ranked the recollections of
            days of heroism, days when great nations found it possible to
            express the best that was in them by the ardent exercise of every
            power that was in them.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">That is what gives dignity to a day like this. It is
            not a day of regret. It is not a day of weakening memory. It is a
            day of stimulation. But, my friends, these stimulating memories we
            are sometimes apt to minimize because we do not see the full
            significance of them. We are constantly speaking of <word altform="Civil War">the great war</word> of which we think <word altform="today">to-day</word> as a war which saved the Union, and
            it did indeed save the Union, but it was a war that did a great deal
            more than that. It created in this country what had never existed
            before,—a national consciousness. It was not the salvation of the
            Union; it was the rebirth of the Union. It was the time when
               <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> for the first time realized its unity and
            saw the vision of its united destiny.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The solemn lesson of these memories for us is not that
            we must be ready to save the Union again, for there is none among us
            who threaten its life, but that we must see to it that the unity
            then realized, the vision then seen, is exemplified in us and in the
            things that we do. There is no stimulation in any lesson unless it
            be the stimulation to duty. There is no stimulation in any occasion
            if it be merely the pleasure of recollection; it must also be the
            ardor and courage of hope. Greater days lie before this nation than
            it has ever seen yet; and the solemn consciousness of those who bear
            office in this time is that they must make their best endeavor to
            embody in what they do and say and are, the best things in the
               <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place>.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">It does not do to talk too much about one’s self, and
            I do not think that it is wholesome for the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United
            States</place> to talk too much about itself. I do not want to know
            what you are today so much as I want to know what you are going to
            do tomorrow. The only test I know of that is competent to determine
            what you are is the test of what you do. Let us not think of our
            characters; let us think of our duties and of the actions that lie
            before us. I have always maintained that the man who lives to
            cultivate his own character will result only in cultivating an
            intolerable prig, because his object will be himself. Character, my
            friends, is a by-product; it is produced in the great manufacture of
            daily duty. Duty is not easy to determine. Duty for a nation is made
            up of so many complicated elements that no man can determine it. No
            group of men without wide common counsel can possibly determine what
            the duty of the day is. That is the strength of a democracy, because
            there daily rises in the great body of a democracy the expression of
            an untrammeled opinion which seems to fill the air with its
            suggestions of duty; and those who stand at the head of affairs have
            it as their bounden obligation to endeavor to express in their own
            actions those things that seem to rise out of the conscience and
            hope and purpose of the great body of the people themselves.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve"><place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place>, I have said, was reborn by the
            struggle of the Civil War, but <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> is reborn
            every day of her life by the purposes we form, the conceptions we
            entertain, the hopes that we cherish. We live in our visions. We
            live in the things that we see. We live, and hope abounds in us as
            we live, in the things that we purpose. Let us go away from this
            place renewed in our devotion to daily duty and to those ideals
            which keep a nation young, keep it noble, keep it rich in enterprise
            and achievement; make it to lead the nations of the world in those
            things that make for hope and for the benefit of mankind.</p>

            <render as="smallcap" rend="inherit">Friends and Fellow-Citizens</render>:</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I know of nothing more difficult than to render an
            adequate tribute to the emblem of our nation. For those of us who
            have shared that nation’s life and felt the beat of its pulse it
            must be considered a matter of impossibility to express the great
            things which that emblem embodies. I venture to say that a great
            many things are said about the flag which very few people stop to
            analyze. For me the flag does not express a mere body of vague
            sentiment. The flag of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> has not been
            created by rhetorical sentences in declarations of independence and
            in bills of rights. It has been created by the experience of a great
            people, and nothing is written upon it that has not been written by
            their life. It is the embodiment, not of a sentiment, but of a
            history, and no man can rightly serve under that flag who has not
            caught some of the meaning of that history.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Experience, ladies and gentlemen, is made by men and
            women. National experience is the product of those who do the living
            under that flag. It is their living that has created its
            significance. You do not create the meaning of a national life by
            any literary exposition of it, but by the actual daily endeavors of
            a great people to do the tasks of the day and live up to the ideals
            of honesty and righteousness and just conduct. And as we think of
            these things, our tribute is to those men who have created this
            experience. Many of them are known by name to all the
            world,—statesmen, soldiers, merchants, masters of industry, men of
            letters and of thought who have coined our hearts into action or
            into words. Of these men we feel that they have shown us the way.
            They have not been afraid to go before. They have known that they
            were speaking the thoughts of a great people when they led that
            great people along the paths of achievement. There was not a single
            swashbuckler among them. They were men of sober, quiet thought, the
            more effective because there was no bluster in it. They were men who
            thought along the lines of duty, not along the lines of
            self-aggrandizement. They were men, in short, who thought of the
            people whom they served and not of themselves.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">But while we think of these men and do honor to them
            as to those who have shown us the way, let us not forget that the
            real experience and life of a nation lies with the great multitude
            of unknown men. It lies with those men whose names are never in the
            headlines of newspapers, those men who know the heat and pain and
            desperate loss of hope that sometimes comes in the great struggle of
            daily life; not the men who stand on the side and comment, not the
            men who merely try to interpret the great struggle, but the men who
            are engaged in the struggle. They constitute the body of the nation.
            This flag is the essence of their daily endeavors. This flag does
            not express any more than what they are and what they desire to be.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">As I think of the life of this great nation it seems
            to me that we sometimes look to the wrong places for its sources. We
            look to the noisy places, where men are talking in the market place;
            we look to where men are expressing their individual opinions; we
            look to where partisans are expressing passion: instead of trying to
            attune our ears to that voiceless mass of men who merely go about
            their daily tasks, try to be honorable, try to serve the people they
            love, try to live worthy of the great communities to which they
            belong. These are the breath of the nation’s nostrils; these are the
            sinew of its might.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">How can any man presume to interpret the emblem of the
               <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place>, the emblem of what we would fain be
            among the family of nations, and find it incumbent upon us to be in
            the daily round of routine duty? This is Flag Day, but that only
            means that it is a day when we are to recall the things which we
            should do every day of our lives. There are no days of special
            patriotism. There are no days when we should be more patriotic than
            on other days. We celebrate the <date value="9999-07-04">Fourth of
               July</date> merely because the great enterprise of liberty was
            started on the <date value="9999-07-04">fourth of July</date> in
               <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place>, but the great enterprise of liberty was
            not begun in <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place>. It is illustrated by the blood
            of thousands of martyrs who lived and died before the great
            experiment on this side of the water. The <date value="9999-07-04">Fourth of July</date> merely marks the day when we consecrated
            ourselves as a nation to this high thing which we pretend to serve.
            The benefit of a day like this is merely in turning away from the
            things that distract us, turning away from the things that touch us
            personally and absorb our interest in the hours of daily work. We
            remind ourselves of those things that are greater than we are, of
            those principles by which we believe our hearts to be elevated, of
            the more difficult things that we must undertake in these days of
            perplexity when a man’s judgment is safest only when it follows the
            line of principle.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I am solemnized in the presence of such a day. I would
            not undertake to speak your thoughts. You must interpret them for
            me. But I do feel that back, not only of every public official, but
            of every man and woman of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place>, there
            marches that great host which has brought us to the present day; the
            host that has never forgotten the vision which it saw at the birth
            of the nation; the host which always responds to the dictates of
            humanity and of liberty; the host that will always constitute the
            strength and the great body of friends of every man who does his
            duty to the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place>.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I am sorry that you do not wear a little flag of the
            Union every day instead of some days. I can only ask you, if you
            lose the physical emblem, to be sure that you wear it in your heart,
            and the heart of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> shall interpret the heart of
            the world.</p>

            generation should have witnessed what you have witnessed in the
            crowded fifty years which you celebrate <word altform="tonight">to-night</word>. You took part when you were young men in a
            struggle the meaning of which, I dare say, you thought would not be
            revealed during your lifetime, and yet more has happened in the
            making of this Nation in your lifetime than has ever happened in the
            making of any other nation in the lifetime of a dozen generations.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The Nation in which you now live is not the Nation for
            whose union you fought. You have seen many things come about which
            have made this Nation one of the representative nations of the world
            with regard to the modern spirit of that world, and you have the
            satisfaction, which I dare say few soldiers have ever had, of
            looking back upon <word altform="Civil War">a war</word> absolutely
            unique in this, that instead of destroying it healed, that instead
            of making a permanent division it made a permanent union. You have
            seen something more interesting than that, because there is a sense
            in which the things of the heart are more interesting than the
            things of the mind. This Nation was from the beginning a spiritual
            enterprise, and you have seen the spirits of the two once divided
            sections of this country absolutely united. A war which seemed as if
            it had the seed of every kind of bitterness in it has seen a single
            generation put bitterness absolutely out of its heart, and you feel,
            as I am sure the men who fought against you feel, that you were
            comrades even then, though you did not know it, and that now you
            know that you are comrades in a common love for a country which you
            are equally eager to serve.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">This is a miracle of the spirit, so far as national
            history is concerned. This is one of the very few wars in which in
            one sense everybody engaged may take pride. Some wars are to be
            regretted; some wars mar the annals of history; but some wars,
            contrasted with those, make those annals distinguished, show that
            the spirit of man sometimes springs to great enterprises that are
            even greater than his own mind had conceived.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">So it seems to me that, standing in a presence like
            this, no man, whether he be in the public service or in the ranks of
            private citizens merely, can fail to feel the challenge to his own
            heart, can fail to feel the challenge to a new consecration to the
            things that we all believe in. The thing that sinks deepest in my
            heart as I try to realize the memories that must be crowding upon
            you is this: You set the Nation free for that great career of
            development, of unhampered development, which the world has
            witnessed since the Civil War; but for my own part I would not be
            proud of the extraordinary physical development of this country, of
            its extraordinary development in material wealth and financial
            power, did I not believe that the people of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United
            States</place> wished all of this power devoted to ideal ends. There
            have been other nations as rich as we; there have been other nations
            as powerful; there have been other nations as spirited; but I hope
            we shall never forget that we created this Nation, not to serve
            ourselves, but to serve mankind.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I love this country because it is my home, but every
            man loves his home. It does not suffice that I should be attached to
            it because it contains the places and the persons whom I
            love—because it contains the threads of my own life. That does not
            suffice for patriotic duty. I should also love it, and I hope I do
            love it, as a great instrument for the uplift of mankind; and what
            you, gentlemen, have to remind us of as you look back through a
            lifetime to the great war in which you took part is that you fought
            that this instrument meant for the service of mankind should not be
            impaired either in its material or in its spiritual power.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I hope I may say without even an implication of
            criticism upon any other great people in the world that it has
            always seemed to me that the people of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United
            States</place> wished to be regarded as devoted to the promotion of
            particular principles of human right. The <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United
            States</place> were founded, not to provide free homes, but to
            assert human rights. This flag meant a great enterprise of the human
            spirit. Nobody, no large bodies of men, in the time that flag was
            first set up believed with a very firm belief in the efficacy of
            democracy. Do you realize that only so long ago as the time of the
            American Revolution democracy was regarded as an experiment in the
            world and we were regarded as rash experimenters? But we not only
            believed in it; we showed that our belief was well founded and that
            a nation as powerful as any in the world could be erected upon the
            will of the people; that, indeed, there was a power in such a nation
            that dwelt in no other nation unless also in that other nation the
            spirit of the people prevailed.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Democracy is the most difficult form of government,
            because it is the form under which you have to persuade the largest
            number of persons to do anything in particular. But I think we were
            the more pleased to undertake it because it is difficult. Anybody
            can do what is easy. We have shown that we could do what was hard,
            and the pride that ought to dwell in your hearts <word altform="tonight">to-night</word> is that you saw to it that that
            experiment was brought to the day of its triumphant demonstration.
            We now know, and the world knows, that the thing that we then
            undertook, rash as it seemed, has been practicable, and that we have
            set up in the world a government maintained and promoted by the
            general conscience and the general conviction.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">So I stand here not to welcome you to <placeRef reg="Washington, DC" link-pointer-type="place">the Nation’s capital</placeRef> as if I were
            your host but merely to welcome you to your own capital, because I
            am, and am proud to be, your servant. I hope I shall catch, as I
            hope we shall all catch, from the spirit of this occasion a new
            consecration to the high duties of American citizenship.</p>

            <render as="smallcap" rend="inherit">Madam President and Ladies and
            Gentlemen:</render>
         </p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Again it is my very great privilege to welcome you to
            the <place reg="Washington, DC" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">City of Washington</place> and to
            the hospitalities of the Capital. May I admit a point of ignorance?
            I was surprised to learn that this association is so young, and that
            an association so young should devote itself wholly to memory I can
            not believe. For to me the duties to which you are consecrated are
            more than the duties and the pride of memory.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">There is a very great thrill to be had from the
            memories of the American Revolution, but the American Revolution was
            a beginning, not a consummation, and the duty laid upon us by that
            beginning is the duty of bringing the things then begun to a noble
            triumph of completion. For it seems to me that the peculiarity of
            patriotism in <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> is that it is not a mere
            sentiment. It is an active principle of conduct. It is something
            that was born into the world, not to please it but to regenerate it.
            It is something that was born into the world to replace systems that
            had preceded it and to bring men out upon a new plane of privilege.
            The glory of the men whose memories you honor and perpetuate is that
            they saw this vision, and it was a vision of the future. It was a
            vision of great days to come when a little handful of three million
            people upon the borders of a single sea should have become a great
            multitude of free men and women spreading across a great continent,
            dominating the shores of two oceans, and sending West as well as
            East the influences of individual freedom. These things were
            consciously in their minds as they framed the great Government which
            was born out of the American Revolution; and every time we gather to
            perpetuate their memories it is incumbent upon us that we should be
            worthy of recalling them and that we should endeavor by every means
            in our power to emulate their example.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The American Revolution was the birth of a nation; it
            was the creation of a great free republic based upon traditions of
            personal liberty which theretofore had been confined to a <place reg="England" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">single little island</place>, but which it was
            purposed should spread to all mankind. And the singular fascination
            of American history is that it has been a process of constant
            re-creation, of making over again in each generation the thing which
            was conceived at first. You know how peculiarly necessary that has
            been in our case, because <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> has not grown by
            the mere multiplication of the original stock. It is easy to
            preserve tradition with continuity of blood; it is easy in a single
            family to remember the origins of the race and the purposes of its
            organization; but it is not so easy when that race is constantly
            being renewed and augmented from other sources, from stocks that did
            not carry or originate the same principles.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">So from generation to generation strangers have had to
            be indoctrinated with the principles of the American family, and the
            wonder and the beauty of it all has been that the infection has been
            so generously easy. For the principles of liberty are united with
            the principles of hope. Every individual, as well as every Nation,
            wishes to realize the best things that is in him, the best thing
            that can be conceived out of the materials of which his spirit is
            constructed. It has happened in a way that fascinates the
            imagination that we have not only been augmented by additions from
            outside, but that we have been greatly stimulated by those
            additions. Living in the easy prosperity of a free people, knowing
            that the sun had always been free to shine upon us and prosper our
            undertakings, we did not realize how hard the task of liberty is and
            how rare the privilege of liberty is; but men were drawn out of
            every climate and out of every race because of an irresistible
            attraction of their spirits to the American ideal. They thought of
               <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> as lifting, like <placeRef reg="Statue of Liberty" link-pointer-type="place">that great statue</placeRef> in the
            harbor of <place reg="New York, NY" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">New York</place>, a torch to
            light the pathway of men to the things that they desire, and men of
            all sorts and conditions struggled toward that light and came to our
            shores with an eager desire to realize it, and a hunger for it such
            as some of us no longer felt, for we were as if satiated and
            satisfied and were indulging ourselves after a fashion that did not
            belong to the ascetic devotion of the early devotees of those great
            principles. Strangers came to remind us of what we had promised
            ourselves and through ourselves had promised mankind. All men came
            to us and said, “Where is the bread of life with which you promised
            to feed us, and have you partaken of it yourselves?” For my part, I
            believe that the constant renewal of this people out of foreign
            stocks has been a constant source of reminder to this people of what
            the inducement was that was offered to men who would come and be of
            our number.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Now we have come to a time of special stress and test.
            There never was a time when we needed more clearly to conserve the
            principles of our own patriotism than this present time. The rest of
            the world from which our polities were drawn seems for the time in
            the crucible and no man can predict what will come out of that
            crucible. We stand apart, unembroiled, conscious of our own
            principles, conscious of what we hope and purpose, so far as our
            powers permit, for the world at large, and it is necessary that we
            should consolidate the American principle. Every political action,
            every social action, should have for its object in
            <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> at this time to challenge the spirit of
               <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place>; to ask that every man and woman who
            thinks first of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> should rally to the standards
            of our life. There have been some among us who have not thought
            first of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place>, who have thought to use the might
            of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> in some matter not of America’s
            origination. They have forgotten that the first duty of a nation is
            to express its own individual principles in the action of the family
            of nations and not to seek to aid and abet any rival or contrary
            ideal.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Neutrality is a negative word. It is a word that does
            not express what <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> ought to feel.
               <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> has a heart and that heart throbs with all
            sorts of intense sympathies, but <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> has schooled
            its heart to love the things that <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> believes in
            and it ought to devote itself only to the things that
            <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> believes in; and, believing that
               <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> stands apart in its ideals, it ought not
            to allow itself to be drawn, so far as its heart is concerned into
            anybody’s quarrel. Not because it does not understand the quarrel,
            not because it does not in its head assess the merits of the
            controversy, but because <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> has promised the
            world to stand apart and maintain certain principles of action which
            are grounded in law and in justice. We are not trying to keep out of
            trouble; we are trying to preserve the foundations upon which peace
            can be rebuilt. Peace can be rebuilt only upon the ancient and
            accepted principles of international law, only upon those things
            which remind nations of their duties to each other, and, deeper than
            that, of their duties to mankind and to humanity.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve"><place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> has a great cause which is not
            confined to the American continent. It is the cause of humanity
            itself. I do not mean in anything that I say even to imply a
            judgment upon any nation or upon any policy, for my object here this
            afternoon is not to sit in judgment upon anybody but ourselves and
            to challenge you to assist all of us who are trying to make
               <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> more than ever conscious of her own
            principles and her own duty. I look forward to the necessity in
            every political agitation in the years which are immediately at hand
            of calling upon every man to declare himself, where he stands. Is it
               <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> first or is it not?</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">We ought to be very careful about some of the
            impressions that we are forming just now. There is too general an
            impression, I fear, that very large numbers of our fellow-citizens
            born in other lands have not entertained with sufficient intensity
            and affection the American ideal. But the number of such is, I am
            sure, not large. Those who would seek to represent them are very
            vocal, but they are not very influential. Some of the best stuff of
               <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> has come out of foreign lands, and some of
            the best stuff in <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> is in the men who are
            naturalized citizens of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place>. I would
            not be afraid upon the test of “America first” to take a census of
            all the foreign-born citizens of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place>,
            for I know that the vast majority of them came here because they
            believed in <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place>; and their belief in
               <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> has made them better citizens than some
            people who were born in <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place>. They can say that
            they have bought this privilege with a great price. They have left
            their homes, they have left their kindred, they have broken all the
            nearest and dearest ties of human life in order to come to a new
            land, take a new rootage, begin a new life, and so by self-sacrifice
            express their confidence in a new principle; whereas, it cost us
            none of these things. We were born into this privilege; we were
            rocked and cradled in it; we did nothing to create it; and it is,
            therefore, the greater duty on our part to do a great deal to
            enhance it and preserve it. I am not deceived as to the balance of
            opinion among the foreign-born citizens of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United
            States</place>, but I am in a hurry for an opportunity to have a
            line-up and let the men who are thinking first of other countries
            stand on one side and all those that are for <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place>
            first, last, and all the time on the other side.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Now, you can do a great deal in this direction. When I
            was a college officer I used to be very much opposed to hazing; not
            because hazing is not wholesome, but because sophomores are poor
            judges. I remember a very dear friend of mine, a professor of ethics
            on the other side of the water, was asked if he thought it was ever
            justifiable to tell a lie. He said Yes, he thought it was sometimes
            justifiable to lie; “but,” he said, “it is so difficult to judge of
            the justification that I usually tell the truth.” I think that ought
            to be the motto of the sophomore. There are freshmen who need to be
            hazed, but the need is to be judged by such nice tests that a
            sophomore is hardly old enough to determine them. But the world can
            determine them. We are not freshmen at college, but we are
            constantly hazed. I would a great deal rather be obliged to draw
            pepper up my nose than to observe the hostile glances of my
            neighbors. I would a great deal rather be beaten than ostracized. I
            would a great deal rather endure any sort of physical hardship if I
            might have the affection of my fellow-men. We constantly discipline
            our fellow-citizens by having an opinion about them. That is the
            sort of discipline we ought now to administer to everybody who is
            not to the very core of his heart an American. Just have an opinion
            about him and let him experience the atmospheric effects of that
            opinion! And I know of no body of persons comparable to a body of
            ladies for creating an atmosphere of opinion! I have myself in part
            yielded to the influences of that atmosphere, though it took me a
            long time to determine how I was going to vote in <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">New
            Jersey</place>.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">So it has seemed to me that my privilege this
            afternoon was not merely a privilege of courtesy, but the real
            privilege of reminding you—for I am sure I am doing nothing more—of
            the great principles which we stand associated to promote. I for my
            part rejoice that we belong to a country in which the whole business
            of government is so difficult. We do not take orders from anybody;
            it is a universal communication of conviction, the most subtle,
            delicate, and difficult of processes. There is not a single
            individual’s opinion that is not of some consequence in making up
            the grand total, and to be in this great cooperative effort is the
            most stimulating thing in the world. A man standing alone may well
            misdoubt his own judgment. He may mistrust his own intellectual
            processes; he may even wonder if his own heart leads him right in
            matters of public conduct; but if he finds his heart part of the
            great throb of a national life, there can be no doubt about it. If
            that is his happy circumstance, then he may know that he is part of
            one of the great forces of the world.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I would not feel any exhilaration in belonging to
               <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> if I did not feel that she was something
            more than a rich and powerful nation. I should not feel proud to be
            in some respects and for a little while her spokesman if I did not
            believe that there was something else than physical force behind
            her. I believe that the glory of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> is that she
            is a great spiritual conception and that in the spirit of her
            institutions dwells not only her distinction but her power. The one
            thing that the world can not permanently resist is the moral force
            of great and triumphant convictions.</p>

            Gentlemen</render>:</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I warmly felicitate the club upon the completion of
            fifty years of successful and interesting life. Club life may be
            made to mean a great deal to those who know how to use it. I have no
            doubt that to a great many of you has come genuine stimulation in
            the associations of this place and that as the years have multiplied
            you have seen more and more the useful ends which may be served by
            organizations of this sort.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">But I have not come to speak wholly of that, for there
            are others of your own members who can speak of the club with a
            knowledge and an intelligence which no one can have who has not been
            intimately associated with it. Men band themselves together for the
            sake of the association no doubt, but also for something greater and
            deeper than that,—because they are conscious of common interests
            lying outside their business occupations, because they are members
            of the same community and in frequent intercourse find mutual
            stimulation and a real maximum of vitality and power. I shall assume
            that here around the dinner table on this memorable occasion our
            talk should properly turn to the wide and common interests which are
            most in our thoughts, whether they be the interests of the community
            or of the nation.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">A year and a half ago our thought would have been
            almost altogether of great domestic questions. They are many and of
            vital consequence. We must and shall address ourselves to their
            solution with diligence, firmness, and self-possession,
            notwithstanding we find ourselves in the midst of a world disturbed
            by great disaster and ablaze with terrible war; but our thought is
            now inevitably of new things about which formerly we gave ourselves
            little concern. We are thinking now chiefly of our relations with
            the rest of the world,—not our commercial relations,—about those we
            have thought and planned always,—but about our political relations,
            our duties as an individual and independent force in the world to
            ourselves, our neighbors, and the world itself.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Our principles are well known. It is not necessary to
            avow them again. We believe in political liberty and founded our
            great government to obtain it, the liberty of men and of peoples,—of
            men to choose their own lives and of peoples to choose their own
            allegiance. Our ambition, also, all the world has knowledge of. It
            is not only to be free and prosperous ourselves, but also to be the
            friend and thoughtful partisan of those who are free or who desire
            freedom the world over. If we have had aggressive purposes and
            covetous ambitions, they were the fruit of our thoughtless youth as
            a nation and we have put them aside. We shall, I confidently
            believe, never again take another foot of territory by conquest. We
            shall never in any circumstances seek to make an independent people
            subject to our dominion; because we believe, we passionately
            believe, in the right of every people to choose their own allegiance
            and be free of masters altogether. For ourselves we wish nothing but
            the full liberty of self-development; and with ourselves in this
            great matter we associate all the peoples of our own hemisphere. We
            wish not only for the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> but for them the
            fullest freedom of independent growth and of action, for we know
            that throughout this hemisphere the same aspirations are everywhere
            being worked out, under diverse conditions but with the same impulse
            and ultimate object.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">All this is very clear to us and will, I confidently
            predict, become more and more clear to the whole world as the great
            processes of the future unfold themselves. It is with a full
            consciousness of such principles and such ambitions that we are
            asking ourselves at the present time what our duty is with regard to
            the armed force of the Nation. Within a year we have witnessed what
            we did not believe possible, a great European conflict involving
            many of the greatest nations of the world. The influences of a great
            war are everywhere in the air. All <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Europe</place> is
            embattled. Force everywhere speaks out with a loud and imperious
            voice in a titanic struggle of governments, and from one end of our
            own dear country to the other men are asking one another what our
            own force is, how far we are prepared to maintain ourselves against
            any interference with our national action or development.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">In no man’s mind, I am sure, is there even raised the
            question of the wilful use of force on our part against any nation
            or any people. No matter what military or naval force the
               <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> might develop, statesmen throughout
            the whole world might rest assured that we were gathering that
            force, not for attack in any quarter, not for aggression of any
            kind, not for the satisfaction of any political or international
            ambition, but merely to make sure of our own security. We have it in
            mind to be prepared, not for war, but only for defense; and with the
            thought constantly in our minds that the principles we hold most
            dear can be achieved by the slow processes of history only in the
            kindly and wholesome atmosphere of peace, and not by the use of
            hostile force. The mission of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> in the world is
            essentially a mission of peace and good will among men. She has
            become the home and asylum of men of all creeds and races. Within
            her hospitable borders they have found homes and congenial
            associations and freedom and a wide and cordial welcome, and they
            have become part of the bone and sinew and spirit of
            <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> itself. <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> has been made
            up out of the nations of the world and is the friend of the nations
            of the world.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">But we feel justified in preparing ourselves to
            vindicate our right to independent and unmolested action by making
            the force that is in us ready for assertion.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">And we know that we can do this in a way that will be
            itself an illustration of the American spirit. In accordance with
            our American traditions we want and shall work for only an army
            adequate to the constant and legitimate uses of times of
            international peace. But we do want to feel that there is a great
            body of citizens who have received at least the most rudimentary and
            necessary forms of military training; that they will be ready to
            form themselves into a fighting force at the call of the nation; and
            that the nation has the munitions and supplies with which to equip
            them without delay should it be necessary to call them into action.
            We wish to supply them with the training they need, and we think we
            can do so without calling them at any time too long away from their
            civilian pursuits.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">It is with this idea, with this conception, in mind
            that the plans have been made which it will be my privilege to lay
            before the Congress at its next session. That plan calls for only
            such an increase in the regular Army of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United
            States</place> as experience has proved to be required for the
            performance of the necessary duties of the Army in the
               <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Philippines</place>, in <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Hawaii</place>, in <place reg="Puerto Rico" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Porto Rico</place>, upon the borders of the
               <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place>, at the coast fortifications, and at
            the military posts of the interior. For the rest, it calls for the
            training within the next three years of a force of 400,000 citizen
            soldiers to be raised in annual contingents of 133,000, who would be
            asked to enlist for three years with the colors and three years on
            furlough, but who during their three years of enlistment with the
            colors would not be organized as a standing force but would be
            expected merely to undergo intensive training for a very brief
            period of each year. Their training would take place in immediate
            association with the organized units of the regular Army. It would
            have no touch of the amateur about it, neither would it exact of the
            volunteers more than they could give in any one year from their
            civilian pursuits.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">And none of this would be done in such a way as in the
            slightest degree to supersede or subordinate our present serviceable
            and efficient National Guard. On the contrary, the National Guard
            itself would be used as part of the instrumentality by which
            training would be given the citizens who enlisted under the new
            conditions, and I should hope and expect that the legislation by
            which all this would be accomplished would put the National Guard
            itself upon a better and more permanent footing than it has ever
            been before, giving it not only the recognition which it deserves,
            but a more definite support from the national government and a more
            definite connection with the military organization of the nation.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">What we all wish to accomplish is that the forces of
            the nation should indeed be part of the nation and not a separate
            professional force, and the chief cost of the system would not be in
            the enlistment or in the training of the men, but in the providing
            of ample equipment in case it should be necessary to call all forces
            into the field.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Moreover, it has been American policy time out of mind
            to look to the Navy as the first and chief line of defense. The Navy
            of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> is already a very great and
            efficient force. Not rapidly, but slowly, with careful attention,
            our naval force has been developed until the Navy of the
               <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> stands recognized as one of the most
            efficient and notable of the modern time. All that is needed in
            order to bring it to a point of extraordinary force and efficiency
            as compared with the other navies of the world is that we should
            hasten our pace in the policy we have long been pursuing, and that
            chief of all we should have a definite policy of development, not
            made from year to year but looking well into the future and planning
            for a definite consummation. We can and should profit in all that we
            do by the experience and example that have been made obvious to us
            by the military and naval events of the actual present. It is not
            merely a matter of building battleships and cruisers and submarines,
            but also a matter of making sure that we shall have the adequate
            equipment of men and munitions and supplies for the vessels we build
            and intend to build. Part of our problem is the problem of what I
            may call the mobilization of the resources of the nation at the
            proper time if it should ever be necessary to mobilize them for
            national defense. We shall study efficiency and adequate equipment
            as carefully as we shall study the number and size of our ships, and
            I believe that the plans already in part made public by the Navy
            Department are plans which the whole nation can approve with
            rational enthusiasm.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">No thoughtful man feels any panic haste in this
            matter. The country is not threatened from any quarter. She stands
            in friendly relations with all the world. Her resources are known
            and her self-respect and her capacity to care for her own citizens
            and her own rights. There is no fear amongst us. Under the new-world
            conditions we have become thoughtful of the things which all
            reasonable men consider necessary for security and self-defense on
            the part of every nation confronted with the great enterprise of
            human liberty and independence. That is all.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Is the plan we propose sane and reasonable and suited
            to the needs of the hour? Does it not conform to the ancient
            traditions of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place>? Has any better plan been
            proposed than this programme that we now place before the country?
            In it there is no pride of opinion. It represents the best
            professional and expert judgment of the country. But I am not so
            much interested in programmes as I am in safeguarding at every cost
            the good faith and honor of the country. If men differ with me in
            this vital matter, I shall ask them to make it clear how far and in
            what way they are interested in making the permanent interests of
            the country safe against disturbance.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">In the fulfillment of the programme I propose I shall
            ask for the hearty support of the country, of the rank and file of
               <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place>, of men of all shades of political
            opinion. For my position in this important matter is different from
            that of the private individual who is free to speak his own thoughts
            and to risk his own opinions in this matter. We are here dealing
            with things that are vital to the life of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place>
            itself. In doing this I have tried to purge my heart of all personal
            and selfish motives. For the time being, I speak as the trustee and
            guardian of a nation’s rights, charged with the duty of speaking for
            that nation in matters involving her sovereignty,—a nation too big
            and generous to be exacting and yet courageous enough to defend its
            rights and the liberties of its people wherever assailed or invaded.
            I would not feel that I was discharging the solemn obligation I owe
            the country were I not to speak in terms of the deepest solemnity of
            the urgency and necessity of preparing ourselves to guard and
            protect the rights and privileges of our people, our sacred heritage
            of the fathers who struggled to make us an independent nation.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The only thing within our own borders that has given
            us grave concern in recent months has been that voices have been
            raised in <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> professing to be the voices of
            Americans which were not indeed and in truth American, but which
            spoke alien sympathies, which came from men who loved other
            countries better than they loved <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place>, men who
            were partisans of other, causes than that of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place>
            and had forgotten that their chief and only allegiance was to the
            great government under which they live. These voices have not been
            many, but they have been very loud and very clamorous. They have
            proceeded from a few who were bitter and who were grievously misled.
               <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> has not opened its doors in vain to men
            and women out of other nations. The vast majority of those who have
            come to take advantage of her hospitality have united their spirits
            with hers as well as their fortunes. These men who speak alien
            sympathies are not their spokesmen but are the spokesmen of small
            groups whom it is high time that the nation should call to a
            reckoning. The chief thing necessary in <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> in
            order that she should let all the world know that she is prepared to
            maintain her own great position is that the real voice of the nation
            should sound forth unmistakably and in majestic volume, in the deep
            unison of a common, unhesitating national feeling. I do not doubt
            that upon the first occasion, upon the first opportunity, upon the
            first definite challenge, that voice will speak forth in tones which
            no man can doubt and with commands which no man dare gainsay or
            resist.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">May I not say, while I am speaking of this, that there
            is another danger that we should guard against? We should rebuke not
            only manifestations of racial feeling here in <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place>
            where there should be none, but also every manifestation of
            religious and sectarian antagonism. It does not become
               <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> that within her borders, where every man
            is free to follow the dictates of his conscience and worship God as
            he pleases, men should raise the cry of church against church. To do
            that is to strike at the very spirit and heart of
            <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place>. We are a God-fearing people. We agree to
            differ about methods of worship, but we are united in believing in
            Divine Providence and in worshiping the God of Nations. We are the
            champions of religious right here and everywhere that it may be our
            privilege to give it our countenance and support. The government is
            conscious of the obligation and the nation is conscious of the
            obligation. Let no man create divisions where there are none.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Here is the nation God has builded by our hands. What
            shall we do with it? Who is there who does not stand ready at all
            times to act in her behalf in a spirit of devoted and disinterested
            patriotism? We are yet only in the youth and first consciousness of
            our power. The day of our country’s life is still but in its fresh
            morning. Let us lift our eyes to the great tracts of life yet to be
            conquered in the interests of righteous peace. Come, let us renew
            our allegiance to <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place>, conserve her strength in
            its purity, make her chief among those who serve mankind,
            self-reverenced, self-commanded, mistress of all forces of quiet
            counsel, strong above all others in good will and the might of
            invincible justice and right.</p>

            Congress</render>: Since I last had the privilege of addressing you
            on the state of the Union <word altform="World War I">the war</word>
            of nations on the other side of the sea, which had then only begun
            to disclose its portentous proportions, has extended its threatening
            and sinister scope until it has swept within its flame some portion
            of every quarter of the globe, not excepting our own hemisphere, has
            altered the whole face of international affairs, and now presents a
            prospect of reorganization and reconstruction such as statesmen and
            peoples have never been called upon to attempt before.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">We have stood apart, studiously neutral. It was our
            manifest duty to do so. Not only did we have no part or interest in
            the policies which seem to have brought the conflict on; it was
            necessary, if a universal catastrophe was to be avoided, that a
            limit should be set to the sweep of destructive war and that some
            part of the great family of nations should keep the processes of
            peace alive, if only to prevent collective economic ruin and the
            breakdown throughout the world of the industries by which its
            populations are fed and sustained. It was manifestly the duty of the
            self-governed nations of this hemisphere to redress, if possible,
            the balance of economic loss and confusion in the other, if they
            could do nothing more. In the day of readjustment and recuperation
            we earnestly hope and believe that they can be of infinite service.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">In this neutrality, to which they were bidden not only
            by their separate life and their habitual detachment from the
            politics of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Europe</place> but also by a clear perception of
            international duty, the states of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> have become
            conscious of a new and more vital community of interest and moral
            partnership in affairs, more clearly conscious of the many common
            sympathies and interests and duties which bid them stand together.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">There was a time in the early days of our own great
            nation and of the republics fighting their way to independence in
               <place reg="Central America" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Central</place> and <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">South
               America</place> when the government of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United
            States</place> looked upon itself as in some sort the guardian of
            the republics to the south of her as against any encroachments or
            efforts at political control from the other side of the water; felt
            it its duty to play the part even without invitation from them; and
            I think that we can claim that the task was undertaken with a true
            and disinterested enthusiasm for the freedom of the Americas and the
            unmolested self-government of her independent peoples. But it was
            always difficult to maintain such a rôle without offence to the
            pride of the peoples whose freedom of action we sought to protect,
            and without provoking serious misconceptions of our motives, and
            every thoughtful man of affairs must welcome the altered
            circumstances of the new day in whose light we now stand, when there
            is no claim of guardianship or thought of wards but, instead, a full
            and honourable association as of partners between ourselves and our
            neighbours, in the interest of all <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place>, north and
            south. Our concern for the independence and prosperity of the states
            of <place reg="Central America" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Central</place> and <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">South
               America</place> is not altered. We retain unabated the spirit
            that has inspired us throughout the whole life of our government and
            which was so frankly put into words by <person reg="James Monroe" link-pointer-type="person">President Monroe</person>. We still mean always to make a common
            cause of national independence and of political liberty in
               <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place>. But that purpose is now better understood
            so far as it concerns ourselves. It is known not to be a selfish
            purpose. It is known to have in it no thought of taking advantage of
            any government in this hemisphere or playing its political fortunes
            for our own benefit. All the governments of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place>
            stand, so far as we are concerned, upon a footing of genuine
            equality and unquestioned independence.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">We have been put to the test in the case of
               <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Mexico</place>, and we have stood the test. Whether we
            have benefited <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Mexico</place> by the course we have pursued
            remains to be seen. Her fortunes are in her own hands. But we have
            at least proved that we will not take advantage of her in her
            distress and undertake to impose upon her an order and government of
            our own choosing. Liberty is often a fierce and intractable thing,
            to which no bounds can be set, and to which no bounds of a few men’s
            choosing ought ever to be set. Every American who has drunk at the
            true fountains of principle and tradition must subscribe without
            reservation to the high doctrine of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Virginia</place> Bill
            of Rights, which in the great days in which our government was set
            up was everywhere amongst us accepted as the creed of free men. That
            doctrine is, “That government is, or ought to be, instituted for the
            common benefit, protection, and security of the people, nation, or
            community;” that “of all the various modes and forms of government,
            that is the best which is capable of producing the greatest degree
            of happiness and safety, and is most effectually secured against the
            danger of maladministration; and that, when any government shall be
            found inadequate or contrary to these purposes, a majority of the
            community hath an indubitable, inalienable, and indefeasible right
            to reform, alter, or abolish it, in such manner as shall be judged
            most conducive to the public weal.” We have unhesitatingly applied
            that heroic principle to the case of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Mexico</place>, and now
            hopefully await the rebirth of the troubled <placeRef reg="Mexico" link-pointer-type="place">Republic</placeRef>, which had so much of which to purge itself
            and so little sympathy from any outside quarter in the radical but
            necessary process. We will aid and befriend <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Mexico</place>,
            but we will not coerce her; and our course with regard to her ought
            to be sufficient proof to all <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> that we seek no
            political suzerainty or selfish control.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The moral is, that the states of
            <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> are not hostile rivals but coöperating
            friends, and that their growing sense of community of interest,
            alike in matters political and in matters economic, is likely to
            give them a new significance as factors in international affairs and
            in the political history of the world. It presents them as in a very
            deep and true sense a unit in world affairs, spiritual partners,
            standing together because thinking together, quick with common
            sympathies and common ideals. Separated they are subject to all the
            cross currents of the confused politics of a world of hostile
            rivalries; united in spirit and purpose they cannot be disappointed
            of their peaceful destiny.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">This is Pan-Americanism. It has none of the spirit of
            empire in it. It is the embodiment, the effectual embodiment, of the
            spirit of law and independence and liberty and mutual service.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">A very notable body of men recently met in the <place reg="Washington, DC" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">City of Washington</place>, at the
            invitation and as the guests of this Government, whose deliberations
            are likely to be looked back to as marking a memorable turning point
            in the history of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place>. They were representative
            spokesmen of the several independent states of this hemisphere and
            were assembled to discuss the financial and commercial relations of
            the republics of the two continents which nature and political
            fortune have so intimately linked together. I earnestly recommend to
            your perusal the reports of their proceedings and of the actions of
            their committees. You will get from them, I think, a fresh
            conception of the ease and intelligence and advantage with which
            Americans of both continents may draw together in practical
            coöperation and of what the material foundations of this hopeful
            partnership of interest must consist,—of how we should build them
            and of how necessary it is that we should hasten their building.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">There is, I venture to point out, an especial
            significance just now attaching to this whole matter of drawing
               <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">the Americas</place> together in bonds of honourable
            partnership and mutual advantage because of the economic
            readjustments which the world must inevitably witness within the
            next generation, when peace shall have at last resumed its healthful
            tasks. In the performance of these tasks I believe <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">the
               Americas</place> to be destined to play their parts together. I
            am interested to fix your attention on this prospect now because
            unless you take it within your view and permit the full significance
            of it to command your thought I cannot find the right light in which
            to set forth the particular matter that lies at the very front of my
            whole thought as I address you to-day. I mean national defense.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">No one who really comprehends the spirit of the great
            people for whom we are appointed to speak can fail to perceive that
            their passion is for peace, their genius best displayed in the
            practice of the arts of peace. Great democracies are not
            belligerent. They do not seek or desire war. Their thought is of
            individual liberty and of the free <word altform="labor">labour</word> that supports life and the uncensored thought that
            quickens it. Conquest and dominion are not in our reckoning, or
            agreeable to our principles. But just because we demand unmolested
            development and the undisturbed government of our own lives upon our
            own principles of right and liberty, we resent, from whatever
            quarter it may come, the aggression we ourselves will not practice.
            We insist upon security in prosecuting our self-chosen lines of
            national development. We do more than that. We demand it also for
            others. We do not confine our enthusiasm for individual liberty and
            free national development to the incidents and movements of affairs
            which affect only ourselves. We feel it wherever there is a people
            that tries to walk in these difficult paths of independence and
            right. From the first we have made common cause with all partisans
            of liberty on this side the sea, and have deemed it as important
            that our <word altform="neighbors">neighbours</word> should be free
            from all outside domination as that we ourselves should be; have set
               <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> aside as a whole for the uses of
            independent nations and political freemen.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Out of such thoughts grow all our policies. We regard
            war merely as a means of asserting the rights of a people against
            aggression. And we are as fiercely jealous of coercive or
            dictatorial power within our own nation as of aggression from
            without. We will not maintain a standing army except for uses which
            are as necessary in times of peace as in times of war; and we shall
            always see to it that our military peace establishment is no larger
            than is actually and continuously needed for the uses of days in
            which no enemies move against us. But we do believe in a body of
            free citizens ready and sufficient to take care of themselves and of
            the governments which they have set up to serve them. In our
            constitutions themselves we have commanded that “the right of the
            people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed,” and our
            confidence has been that our safety in times of danger would lie in
            the rising of the nation to take care of itself, as the farmers rose
            at <place reg="Lexington, MA" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Lexington</place>.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">But war has never been a mere matter of men and guns.
            It is a thing of disciplined might. If our citizens are ever to
            fight effectively upon a sudden summons, they must know how modern
            fighting is done, and what to do when the summons comes to render
            themselves immediately available and immediately effective. And the
            government must be their servant in this matter, must supply them
            with the training they need to take care of themselves and of it.
            The military arm of their government, which they will not allow to
            direct them, they may properly use to serve them and make their
            independence secure,—and not their own independence merely but the
            rights also of those with whom they have made common cause, should
            they also be put in jeopardy. They must be fitted to play the great
            rôle in the world, and particularly in this hemisphere which they
            are qualified by principle and by chastened ambition to play.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">It is with these ideals in mind that the plans of the
            Department of War for more adequate national defense were conceived
            which will be laid before you, and which I urge you to sanction and
            put into effect as soon as they can be properly scrutinized and
            discussed. They seem to me the essential first steps, and they seem
            to me for the present sufficient.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">They contemplate an increase of the standing force of
            the regular army from its present strength of five thousand and
            twenty-three officers and one hundred and two thousand nine hundred
            and eighty-five enlisted men of all services to a strength of seven
            thousand one hundred and thirty-six officers and one hundred and
            thirty-four thousand seven hundred and seven enlisted men, or
            141,843, all told, all services, rank and file, by the addition of
            fifty-two companies of coast artillery, fifteen companies of
            engineers, ten regiments of infantry, four regiments of field
            artillery, and four <word altform="air">aero</word> squadrons,
            besides seven hundred and fifty officers required for a great
            variety of extra service, especially the all important duty of
            training the citizen force of which I shall presently speak, seven
            hundred and ninety-two noncommissioned officers for service in
            drill, recruiting and the like, and the necessary quota of enlisted
            men for the Quartermaster Corps, the Hospital Corps, the Ordnance
            Department, and other similar auxiliary services. These are the
            additions necessary to render the army adequate for its present
            duties, duties which it has to perform not only upon our own
            continental coasts and borders and at our interior army posts, but
            also in the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Philippines</place>, in the <place reg="Hawaii" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Hawaiian Islands</place>, at the <place reg="Panama" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Isthmus</place>, and in <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Porto Rico</place>.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">By way of making the country ready to assert some part
            of its real power promptly and upon a larger scale, should occasion
            arise, the plan also contemplates supplementing the army by a force
            of four hundred thousand disciplined citizens, raised in increments
            of one hundred and thirty-three thousand a year throughout a period
            of three years. This it is proposed to do by a process of enlistment
            under which the serviceable men of the country would be asked to
            bind themselves to serve with the colors for purposes of training
            for short periods throughout three years, and to come to the colors
            at call at any time throughout an additional “furlough” period of
            three years. This force of four hundred thousand men would be
            provided with personal accoutrements as fast as enlisted and their
            equipment for the field made ready to be supplied at any time. They
            would be assembled for training at stated intervals at convenient
            places in association with suitable units of the regular army. Their
            period of annual training would not necessarily exceed two months in
            the year.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">It would depend upon the patriotic feeling of the
            younger men of the country whether they responded to such a call to
            service or not. It would depend upon the patriotic spirit of the
            employers of the country whether they made it possible for the
            younger men in their employ to respond under favorable conditions or
            not. I, for one, do not doubt the patriotic devotion either of our
            young men or of those who give them employment,—those for whose
            benefit and protection they would in fact enlist. I would look
            forward to the success of such an experiment with entire confidence.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">At least so much by way of preparation for defense
            seems to me to be absolutely imperative now. We cannot do less.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The programme which will be laid before you by the
               <personRef refurl="x4005046" reg="Josephus Daniels" link-pointer-type="person">Secretary of the Navy</personRef> is
            similarly conceived. It involves only a shortening of the time
            within which plans long matured shall be carried out; but it does
            make definite and explicit a programme which has heretofore been
            only implicit, held in the minds of the Committees on Naval Affairs
            and disclosed in the debates of the two Houses but nowhere
            formulated or formally adopted. It seems to me very clear that it
            will be to the advantage of the country for the Congress to adopt a
            comprehensive plan for putting the navy upon a final footing of
            strength and efficiency and to press that plan to completion within
            the next five years. We have always looked to the navy of the
            country as our first and chief line of defense; we have always seen
            it to be our manifest course of prudence to be strong on the seas.
            Year by year we have been creating a navy which now ranks very high
            indeed among the navies of the maritime nations. We should now
            definitely determine how we shall complete what we have begun, and
            how soon.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The programme to be laid before you contemplates the
            construction within five years of ten battleships, six battle
            cruisers, ten scout cruisers, fifty destroyers, fifteen fleet
            submarines, eighty-five coast submarines, four gunboats, one
            hospital ship, two ammunition ships, two fuel oil ships, and one
            repair ship. It is proposed that of this number we shall the first
            year provide for the construction of two battle ships, two battle
            cruisers, three scout cruisers, fifteen destroyers, five fleet
            submarines, twenty-five coast submarines, two gunboats, and one
            hospital ship; the second year, two battleships, one scout cruiser,
            ten destroyers, four fleet submarines, fifteen coast submarines, one
            gun boat, and one fuel oil ship; the third year, two battle ships,
            one battle cruiser, two scout cruisers, five destroyers, two fleet
            submarines, and fifteen coast submarines; the fourth year, two

            destroyers, two fleet submarines, fifteen coast submarines, one
            gunboat, one ammunition ship, and one repair ship.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The <personRef refurl="x4005046" reg="Josephus Daniels" link-pointer-type="person">Secretary of

            the personnel of the navy of seven thousand five hundred sailors,
            twenty-five hundred apprentice seamen, and fifteen hundred marines.
            This increase would be sufficient to care for the ships which are to
            be completed within the fiscal year <date value="1917-99-99">1917</date> and also for the number of men which must be put in

            least three hundred in order that the force of officers should be
            more rapidly added to; and authority is asked to appoint, for
            engineering duties only, approved graduates of engineering colleges,
            and for service in the aviation corps a certain number of men taken
            from civil life.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">If this full <word altform="program">programme</word>
            should be carried out we should have built or building in <date value="1921-99-99">1921</date>, according to the estimates of
            survival and standards of classification followed by the General
            Board of the Department, an effective navy consisting of
            twenty-seven battleships, of the first line, six battle cruisers,
            twenty-five battleships of the second line, ten armored cruisers,
            thirteen scout cruisers, five first class cruisers, three second
            class cruisers, ten third class cruisers, one hundred and eight
            destroyers, eighteen fleet submarines, one hundred and fifty-seven
            coast submarines, six monitors, twenty gunboats, four supply ships,
            fifteen fuel ships, four transports, three tenders to torpedo
            vessels, eight vessels of special types, and two ammunition ships.
            This would be a navy fitted to our needs and worthy of our
            traditions.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">But armies and instruments of war are only part of
            what has to be considered if we are to provide for the supreme
            matter of national self-sufficiency and security in all its aspects.
            There are other great matters which will be thrust upon our
            attention whether we will or not. There is, for example, a very
            pressing question of trade and shipping involved in this great
            problem of national adequacy. It is necessary for many weighty
            reasons of national efficiency and development that we should have a
            great merchant marine. The great merchant fleet we once used to make
            us rich, that great body of sturdy sailors who used to carry our
            flag into every sea, and who were the pride and often the bulwark of
            the nation, we have almost driven out of existence by inexcusable
            neglect and indifference and by a hopelessly blind and provincial
            policy of so-called economic protection. It is high time we repaired
            our mistakes and resumed our commercial independence on the seas.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">For it is a question of independence. If other nations
            go to war or seek to hamper each other’s commerce, our merchants, it
            seems, are at their mercy, to do with as they please. We must use
            their ships, and use them as they determine. We have not ships
            enough of our own. We cannot handle our own commerce on the seas.
            Our independence is provincial, and is only on land and within our
            own borders. We are not likely to be permitted to use even the ships
            of other nations in rivalry of their own trade, and are without
            means to extend our commerce even where the doors are wide open and
            our goods desired. Such a situation is not to be endured. It is of
            capital importance not only that the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place>
            should be its own carrier on the seas and enjoy the economic
            independence which only an adequate merchant marine would give it,
            but also that the American hemisphere as a whole should enjoy a like
            independence and self-sufficiency, if it is not to be drawn into the
            tangle of European affairs. Without such independence the whole
            question of our political unity and self-determination is very
            seriously clouded and complicated indeed.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Moreover, we can develop no true or effective American
            policy without ships of our own,—not ships of war, but ships of
            peace, carrying goods and carrying much more: creating friendships
            and rendering indispensable services to all interests on this side
            the water. They must move constantly back and forth between the
            Americas. They are the only shuttles that can weave the delicate
            fabric of sympathy, comprehension, confidence, and mutual dependence
            in which we wish to clothe our policy of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> for
            Americans.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The task of building up an adequate merchant marine
            for <sic corr="American">America</sic> private capital must
            ultimately undertake and achieve, as it has undertaken and achieved
            every other like task amongst us in the past, with admirable
            enterprise, intelligence, and vigor; and it seems to me a manifest
            dictate of wisdom that we should promptly remove every legal
            obstacle that may stand in the way of this much to be desired
            revival of our old independence and should facilitate in every
            possible way the building, purchase, and American registration of
            ships. But capital cannot accomplish this great task of a sudden. It
            must embark upon it by degrees, as the opportunities of trade
            develop. Something must be done at once; done to open routes and
            develop opportunities where they are as yet undeveloped; done to
            open the arteries of trade where the currents have not yet learned
            to run,—especially between the two American continents, where they
            are, singularly enough, yet to be created and quickened; and it is
            evident that only the government can undertake such beginnings and
            assume the initial financial risks. When the risk has passed and
            private capital begins to find its way in sufficient abundance into
            these new channels, the government may withdraw. But it cannot omit
            to begin. It should take the first steps, and should take them at
            once. Our goods must not lie piled up at our ports and stored upon
            side tracks in freight cars which are daily needed on the roads;
            must not be left without means of transport to any foreign quarter.
            We must not await the permission of foreign ship-owners and foreign
            governments to send them where we will.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">With a view to meeting these pressing necessities of
            our commerce and availing ourselves at the earliest possible moment
            of the present unparalled opportunity of linking the two Americas
            together in bonds of mutual interest and service, an opportunity
            which may never return again if we miss it now, proposals will be
            made to the present Congress for the purchase or construction of
            ships to be owned and directed by the government similar to those
            made to the last Congress, but modified in some essential
            particulars. I recommend these proposals to you for your prompt
            acceptance with the more confidence because every month that has
            elapsed since the former proposals were made has made the necessity
            for such action more and more manifestly imperative. That need was
            then foreseen; it is now acutely felt and everywhere realized by
            those for whom trade is waiting but who can find no conveyance for
            their goods. I am not so much interested in the particulars of the
               <word altform="program">programme</word> as I am in taking
            immediate advantage of the great opportunity which awaits us if we
            will but act in this emergency. In this matter, as in all others, a
            spirit of common counsel should prevail, and out of it should come
            an early solution of this pressing problem.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">There is another matter which seems to me to be very
            intimately associated with the question of national safety and
            preparation for defense. That is our policy towards the
               <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Philippines</place> and the people of <place reg="Puerto Rico" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Porto Rico</place>. Our treatment of them and
            their attitude towards us are manifestly of the first consequence in
            the development of our duties in the world and in getting a free
            hand to perform those duties. We must be free from every unnecessary
            burden or embarrassment; and there is no better way to be clear of
            embarrassment than to fulfil our promises and promote the interests
            of those dependent on us to the utmost. Bills for the alteration and
            reform of the government of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Philippines</place> and for
            rendering fuller political justice to the people of <place reg="Puerto Rico" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Porto Rico</place> were submitted to the
            sixty-third Congress. They will be submitted also to you. I need not
            particularize their details. You are most of you already familiar
            with them. But I do recommend them to your early adoption with the
            sincere conviction that there are few measures you could adopt which
            would more serviceably clear the way for the great policies by which
            we wish to make good, now and always, our right to lead in
            enterprises of peace and good will and economic and political
            freedom.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The plans for the armed forces of the nation which I
            have outlined, and for the general policy of adequate preparation
            for mobilization and defense, involve of course very large
            additional expenditures of money,—expenditures which will
            considerably exceed the estimated revenues of the government. It is
            made my duty by law, whenever the estimates of expenditure exceed
            the estimates of revenue, to call the attention of the Congress to
            the fact and suggest any means of meeting the deficiency that it may
            be wise or possible for me to suggest. I am ready to believe that it
            would be my duty to do so in any case; and I feel particularly bound
            to speak of the matter when it appears that the deficiency will
            arise directly out of the adoption by the Congress of measures which
            I myself urge it to adopt. Allow me, therefore, to speak briefly of
            the present state of the Treasury and of the fiscal problems which
            the next year will probably disclose.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">On the <date value="1915-06-30">thirtieth of June
            last</date> there was an available balance in the general fund of
            the Treasury of <currency type="U.S.A">$104,170,105.78</currency>.
            The total estimated receipts for the year <date value="1916-99-99">1916</date>, on the assumption that the emergency revenue
            measure passed by the last Congress will not be extended beyond its
            present limit, the <date value="1915-12-31">thirty-first of
               December, 1915</date>, and that the present duty of one cent per
            pound on sugar will be discontinued after the <date value="1916-05-01">first of May, 1916</date>, will be <currency type="U.S.A">$670,365,500</currency>. The balance of <date value="1915-06-30">June last</date> and these estimated revenues
            come, therefore, to a grand total of <currency type="U.S.A">$774,535,605.78</currency>. The total estimated disbursements
            for the present fiscal year, including <currency type="U.S.A">twenty-five millions</currency> for the Panama Canal, <currency type="U.S.A">twelve millions</currency> for probable deficiency
            appropriations, and <currency type="U.S.A">fifty thousand
            dollars</currency> for miscellaneous debt redemptions, will be
               <currency type="U.S.A">$753,891,000</currency>; and the balance
            in the general fund of the Treasury will be reduced to <currency type="U.S.A">$20,644,605.78</currency>. The emergency revenue
            act, if continued beyond its present time limitation, would produce,
            during the half year then remaining, about <currency type="U.S.A">forty-one millions</currency>. The duty of one cent per pound on
            sugar, if continued, would produce during the two months of the
            fiscal year remaining after the <date value="1916-05-01">first of
               May</date>, about <currency type="U.S.A">fifteen
            millions</currency>. These two sums, amounting together to <currency type="U.S.A">fifty-six millions</currency>, if added to the
            revenues of the second half of the fiscal year, would yield the
            Treasury at the end of the year an available balance of <currency type="U.S.A">$76,644,605.78</currency>.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The additional revenues required to carry out the
               <word altform="program">programme</word> of military and naval
            preparation of which I have spoken, would, as at present estimated,
            be for the fiscal year <date value="1917-99-99">1917</date>,
               <currency type="U.S.A">$93,800,000</currency>. Those figures,
            taken with the figures for the present fiscal year which I have
            already given, disclose our financial problem for the year <date value="1917-99-99">1917</date>. Assuming that the taxes imposed
            by the emergency revenue act and the present duty on sugar are to be
            discontinued, and that the balance at the close of the present
            fiscal year will be only <currency type="U.S.A">$20,644,605.78</currency>, that the disbursements for the Panama
            Canal will again be about <currency type="U.S.A">twenty-five
               millions</currency>, and that the additional expenditures for the
            army and navy are authorized by the Congress, the deficit in the
            general fund of the Treasury on the <date value="1917-06-30">thirtieth of June, 1917</date>, will be nearly <currency type="U.S.A">two hundred and thirty-five millions</currency>. To
            this sum at least <currency type="U.S.A">fifty millions</currency>
            should be added to represent a safe working balance for the
            Treasury, and <currency type="U.S.A">twelve millions</currency> to
            include the usual deficiency estimates in <date value="1917-99-99">1917</date>; and these additions would make a total deficit of
            some <currency type="U.S.A">two hundred and ninety-seven
            millions</currency>. If the present taxes should be continued
            throughout this year and the next, however, there would be a balance
            in the Treasury of some <currency type="U.S.A">seventy-six and a
               half millions</currency> at the end of the present fiscal year,
            and a deficit at the end of the next year of only some <currency type="U.S.A">fifty millions</currency>, or, reckoning in
               <currency type="U.S.A">sixty-two millions</currency> for
            deficiency appropriations and a safe Treasury balance at the end of
            the year, a total deficit of some <currency type="U.S.A">one hundred
               and twelve millions</currency>. The obvious moral of the figures
            is that it is a plain counsel of prudence to continue all of the
            present taxes or their equivalents, and confine ourselves to the
            problem of providing <currency type="U.S.A">one hundred and twelve
               millions</currency> of new revenue rather than <currency type="U.S.A">two hundred and ninety-seven millions</currency>.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">How shall we obtain the new revenue? We are frequently
            reminded that there are many millions of bonds which the Treasury is
            authorized under existing law to sell to reimburse the sums paid out
            of current revenues for the construction of the Panama Canal; and it
            is true that bonds to the amount of approximately <currency type="U.S.A">$222,000,000</currency> are now available for that
            purpose. Prior to <date value="1913-99-99">1913</date>, <currency type="U.S.A">$134,631,980</currency> of these bonds had actually
            been sold to recoup the expenditures at the <placeRef reg="Panama" link-pointer-type="place">Isthmus</placeRef>; and now constitute a considerable item of
            the public debt. But I, for one, do not believe that the people of
            this country approve of postponing the payment of their bills.
            Borrowing money is short-sighted finance. It can be justified only
            when permanent things are to be accomplished which many generations
            will certainly benefit by and which it seems hardly fair that a
            single generation should pay for. The objects we are now proposing
            to spend money for cannot be so classified, except in the sense that
            everything wisely done may be said to be done in the interest of
            posterity as well as in our own. It seems to me a clear dictate of
            prudent statesmanship and frank finance that in what we are now, I
            hope, about to undertake we should pay as we go. The people of the
            country are entitled to know just what burdens of taxation they are
            to carry, and to know from the outset, now. The new bills should be
            paid by internal taxation.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">To what sources, then, shall we turn? This is so
            peculiarly a question which the gentlemen of the House of
            Representatives are expected under the Constitution to propose an
            answer to that you will hardly expect me to do more than discuss it
            in very general terms. We should be following an almost universal
            example of modern governments if we were to draw the greater part or
            even the whole of the revenues we need from the income taxes. By
            somewhat lowering the present limits of exemption and the figure at
            which the surtax shall begin to be imposed, and by increasing, step
            by step throughout the present graduation, the surtax itself, the
            income taxes as at present apportioned would yield sums sufficient
            to balance the books of the Treasury at the end of the fiscal year
               <date value="1917-99-99">1917</date> without anywhere making the
            burden unreasonably or oppressively heavy. The precise reckonings
            are fully and accurately set out in the report of the <personRef refurl="x4005032" reg="William G. McAdoo" link-pointer-type="person">Secretary of the Treasury</personRef>
            which will be immediately laid before you.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">And there are many additional sources of revenue which
            can justly be resorted to without hampering the industries of the
            country or putting any too great charge upon individual expenditure.
            A tax of <currency type="U.S.A">one cent</currency> per gallon on
            gasoline and naptha would yield, at the present estimated
            production, <currency type="U.S.A">$10,000,000</currency>; a tax of
               <currency type="U.S.A">fifty cents</currency> per horse power on
            automobiles and internal explosion engines, <currency type="U.S.A">$15,000,000</currency>; a stamp tax on bank cheques, probably
               <currency type="U.S.A">$18,000,000</currency>; a tax of <currency type="U.S.A">twenty-five cents</currency> per ton on pig iron,
               <currency type="U.S.A">$10,000,000</currency>; a tax of <currency type="U.S.A">twenty-five cents</currency> per ton on fabricated
            iron and steel, probably <currency type="U.S.A">$10,000,000</currency>. In a country of great industries like this
            it ought to be easy to distribute the burdens of taxation without
            making them anywhere bear too heavily or too exclusively upon any
            one set of persons or undertakings. What is clear is, that the
            industry of this generation should pay the bills of this generation.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I have spoken to you to-day, Gentlemen, upon a single
            theme, the thorough preparation of the nation to care for its own
            security and to make sure of entire freedom to play the impartial
            rôle in this hemisphere and in the world which we all believe to
            have been providentially assigned to it. I have had in my mind no
            thought of any immediate or particular danger arising out of our
            relations with other nations. We are at peace with all the nations
            of the world, and there is reason to hope that no question in
            controversy between this and other Governments will lead to any
            serious breach of amicable relations, grave as some differences of
            attitude and policy have been and may yet turn out to be. I am sorry
            to say that the gravest threats against our national peace and
            safety have been uttered within our own borders. There are citizens
            of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place>, I blush to admit, born under
            other flags but welcomed under our generous naturalization laws to
            the full freedom and opportunity of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place>, who have
            poured the poison of disloyalty into the very arteries of our
            national life; who have sought to bring the authority and good name
            of our Government into contempt, to destroy our industries wherever
            they thought it effective for their vindictive purposes to strike at
            them, and to debase our politics to the uses of foreign intrigue.
            Their number is not great as compared with the whole number of those
            sturdy hosts by which our nation has been enriched in recent
            generations out of virile foreign stocks; but it is great enough to
            have brought deep disgrace upon us and to have made it necessary
            that we should promptly make use of processes of law by which we may
            be purged of their corrupt distempers. <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> never
            witnessed anything like this before. It never dreamed it possible
            that men sworn into its own citizenship, men drawn out of great free
            stocks such as supplied some of the best and strongest elements of
            that little, but how heroic, nation that in a high day of old staked
            its very life to free itself from every entanglement that had
            darkened the fortunes of the older nations and set up a new standard
            here,—that men of such origins and such free choices of allegiance
            would ever turn in malign reaction against the Government and people
            who had welcomed and nurtured them and seek to make this proud
            country once more a hotbed of European passion. A little while ago
            such a thing would have seemed incredible. Because it was incredible
            we made no preparation for it. We would have been almost ashamed to
            prepare for it, as if we were suspicious of ourselves, our own
            comrades and neighbors! But the ugly and incredible thing has
            actually come about and we are without adequate federal laws to deal
            with it. I urge you to enact such laws at the earliest possible
            moment and feel that in doing so I am urging you to do nothing less
            than save the honor and self-respect of the nation. Such creatures
            of passion, disloyalty, and anarchy must be crushed out. They are
            not many, but they are infinitely malignant, and the hand of our
            power should close over them at once. They have formed plots to
            destroy property, they have entered into conspiracies against the
            neutrality of the Government, they have sought to pry into every
            confidential transaction of the Government in order to serve
            interests alien to our own. It is possible to deal with these things
            very effectually. I need not suggest the terms in which they may be
            dealt with.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I wish that it could be said that only a few men,
            misled by mistaken sentiments of allegiance to the governments under
            which they were born, had been guilty of disturbing the
            self-possession and misrepresenting the temper and principles of the
            country during these days of terrible war, when it would seem that
            every man who was truly an American would instinctively make it his
            duty and his pride to keep the scales of judgment even and prove
            himself a partisan of no nation but his own. But it cannot. There
            are some men among us, and many resident abroad who, though born and
            bred in the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> and calling themselves
            Americans, have so forgotten themselves and their honor as citizens
            as to put their passionate sympathy with one or the other side in
            the great European conflict above their regard for the peace and
            dignity of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place>. They also preach and
            practice disloyalty. No laws, I suppose, can reach corruptions of
            the mind and heart; but I should not speak of others without also
            speaking of these and expressing the even deeper humiliation and
            scorn which every self-possessed and thoughtfully patriotic American
            must feel when he thinks of them and of the discredit they are daily
            bringing upon us.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">While we speak of the preparation of the nation to
            make sure of her security and her effective power we must not fall
            into the patent error of supposing that her real strength comes from
            armaments and mere safeguards of written law. It comes, of course,
            from her people, their energy, their success in their undertakings,
            their free opportunity to use the natural resources of our great
            home land and of the lands outside our continental borders which
            look to us for protection, for encouragement, and for assistance in
            their development; from the organization and freedom and vitality of
            our economic life. The domestic questions which engaged the
            attention of the last Congress are more vital to the nation in this
            its time of test than at any other time. We cannot adequately make
            ready for any trial of our strength unless we wisely and promptly
            direct the force of our laws into these all-important fields of
            domestic action. A matter which it seems to me we should have very
            much at heart is the creation of the right instrumentalities by
            which to mobilize our economic resources in any time of national
            necessity. I take it for granted that I do not need your authority
            to call into systematic consultation with the directing officers of
            the army and navy men of recognized leadership and ability from
            among our citizens who are thoroughly familiar, for example, with
            the transportation facilities of the country and therefore competent
            to advise how they may be coördinated when the need arises, those
            who can suggest the best way in which to bring about prompt
            coöperation among the manufacturers of the country, should it be
            necessary, and those who could assist to bring the technical skill
            of the country to the aid of the Government in the solution of
            particular problems of defense. I only hope that if I should find it
            feasible to constitute such an advisory body the Congress would be
            willing to vote the small sum of money that would be needed to
            defray the expenses that would probably be necessary to give it the
            clerical and administrative machinery with which to do serviceable
            work.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">What is more important is, that the industries and
            resources of the country should be available and ready for
            mobilization. It is the more imperatively necessary, therefore, that
            we should promptly devise means for doing what we have not yet done:
            that we should give intelligent federal aid and stimulation to
            industrial and vocational education, as we have long done in the
            large field of our agricultural industry; that, at the same time
            that we safeguard and conserve the natural resources of the country
            we should put them at the disposal of those who will use them
            promptly and intelligently, as was sought to be done in the
            admirable bills submitted to the last Congress from its committees
            on the public lands, bills which I earnestly recommend in principle
            to your consideration; that we should put into early operation some
            provision for rural credits which will add to the extensive
            borrowing facilities already afforded the farmer by the Reserve Bank
            Act adequate instrumentalities by which long credits may be obtained
            on land mortgages; and that we should study more carefully than they
            have hitherto been studied the right adaptation of our economic
            arrangements to changing conditions.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Many conditions about which we have repeatedly
            legislated are being altered from decade to decade, it is evident,
            under our very eyes, and are likely to change even more rapidly and
            more radically in the days immediately ahead of us, when peace has
            returned to the world and the nations of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Europe</place> once
            more take up their tasks of commerce and industry with the energy of
            those who must bestir themselves to build anew. Just what these
            changes will be no one can certainly foresee or confidently predict.
            There are no calculable, because no stable, elements in the problem.
            The most we can do is to make certain that we have the necessary
            instrumentalities of information constantly at our service so that
            we may be sure that we know exactly what we are dealing with when we
            come to act, if it should be necessary to act at all. We must first
            certainly know what it is that we are seeking to adapt ourselves to.
            I may ask the privilege of addressing you more at length on this
            important matter a little later in your session.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">In the meantime may I make this suggestion? The
            transportation problem is an exceedingly serious and pressing one in
            this country. There has from time to time of late been reason to
            fear that our railroads would not much longer be able to cope with
            it successfully, as at present equipped and coördinated. I suggest
            that it would be wise to provide for a commission of inquiry to
            ascertain by a thorough canvass of the whole question whether our
            laws as at present framed and administered are as serviceable as
            they might be in the solution of the problem. It is obviously a
            problem that lies at the very foundation of our efficiency as a
            people. Such an inquiry ought to draw out every circumstance and
            opinion worth considering and we need to know all sides of the
            matter if we mean to do anything in the field of federal
            legislation.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">No one, I am sure, would wish to take any backward
            step. The regulation of the railways of the country by federal
            commission has had admirable results and has fully justified the
            hopes and expectations of those by whom the policy of regulation was
            originally proposed. The question is not what should we undo? It is,
            whether there is anything else we can do that would supply us with
            effective means, in the very process of regulation, for bettering
            the conditions under which the railroads are operated and for making
            them more useful servants of the country as a whole. It seems to me
            that it might be the part of wisdom, therefore before further
            legislation in this field is attempted, to look at the whole problem
            of coordination and efficiency in the full light of a fresh
            assessment of circumstance and opinion, as a guide to dealing with
            the several parts of it.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">For what we are seeking now, what in my mind is the
            single thought of this message, is national efficiency and security.
            We serve a great nation. We should serve it in the spirit of its
            peculiar genius. It is the genius of common men for self-government,
            industry, justice, liberty and peace. We should see to it that it
            lacks no instrument, no facility or vigor of law, to make it
            sufficient to play its part with energy, safety, and assured
            success. In this we are no partisans but heralds and prophets of a
            new age.</p>

         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Mr. <render as="smallcap" rend="inherit">Toastmaster and Ladies and
               Gentlemen</render>: I wondered when I was on my way here what
            would be expected of me. It occurred to me that perhaps I would only
            be expected to go through the motions of a speech, and then I
            reflected that, never having seen myself speak and generally having
            my thoughts concentrated upon what I had to say, I had not the least
            notion what my motions were when I made a speech. Because it has
            never occurred to me in my simplicity to make a speech before a
            mirror. If you will give me time, I will rehearse this difficult
            part and return and perform it for you.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I have sometimes been very much chagrined in seeing
            myself in a motion picture. I have wondered if I really was that
            kind of a “guy.” The extraordinary rapidity with which I walked, for
            example, the instantaneous and apparently automatic nature of my
            motion, the way in which I produce uncommon grimaces, and altogether
            the extraordinary exhibition I make of myself sends me to bed very
            unhappy. And I often think to myself that, although all the world is
            a stage and men and women but actors upon it, after all the external
            appearances of things are very superficial indeed. I am very much
            more interested in what my fellow-men are thinking about than in the
            motions through which they are going. While we unconsciously display
            a great deal of human nature in our visible actions, there are some
            very deep waters which no picture can sound.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">When you think of a great nation, ladies and
            gentlemen, you are not thinking of a visible thing; you are thinking
            of a spiritual thing. I suppose a man in public office feels this
            with a peculiar poignancy, because what it is important for him to
            know is the real, genuine sentiments and emotions of the people that
            make up the nation. I found out what was going on in
            <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Mexico</place> in a very singular way,—by hearing a
            sufficiently large number of liars talk about it. I think the
            psychological explanation will interest you.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">You know that the truth is consistent with itself; one
            piece matches another. Now no man is an inventive enough liar not to
            bring in large sections of truth in what he says, and after all the
            liars are done talking to you about the same subject it will come to
            your consciousness that long and large pieces of what they said
            matched; that in that respect they all said the same thing; that the
            variations are lies and the consistencies are the truth. They will
            not all tell you the same piece of the truth, so that if you hear
            enough of them, you may get the whole of the truth. And yet it is
            very tedious to hear men lie, particularly when you know they are
            lying. You feel like reminding them that really your time is
            important to you and that you wish they would get down to business
            and tell you what is really so, but they do not. They want this
            adventure of their invention; they want to give an excursion to
            their minds before they get down to business. What I particularly
            object to is a very able man with a lot of inventions coming to me
            and lying to me, because then the interview is very tedious and long
            before we get down to business. I got to know that story so by heart
            that the last time a deputation visited me about
            <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Mexico</place> I thought I would save time and I told them
            exactly what they were going to say to me. They went away very much
            confused; they wondered how I had heard it, because they knew it was
            not so.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Yet underneath all of this are those great pulses
            which throb in great bodies of men and drive the great affairs of
            state, and I wonder how men venture to try to deceive a great
            nation. There never was a profounder saying than that of <person refurl="x4000471" reg="Abraham Lincoln" link-pointer-type="person">Lincoln</person> that you can fool all
            the people some of the time and some of the people all of the time,
            but you cannot fool all of the people all of the time, and the best
            way in which to silence any friend of yours whom you know to be a
            fool is to induce him to hire a hall. Nothing chills pretense like
            exposure. Nothing will bear the tests of examination for a shorter
            length of time than pretense. At least so I try to persuade myself,
            and yet there are some humbugs that have been at large a long time.
            I suppose that there is always a rising generation whom they can
            fool, but the older heads ought not to permit themselves to be
            fooled.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I should think that in a year like the year
            <date>1916</date>, when there is to be a common reckoning for
            everybody, men would hurry up and begin to tell the truth. They are
            not hurrying about it; they are taking their time, but the American
            people are going to insist upon it before this year is over that
            everybody comes up and is counted on the great questions of the day.
            They are not going to take any excuses, they are not going to take
            any pretenses; they are going to insist upon the goods being
            delivered on the spot, and anybody that declines to deliver them is
            going to go bankrupt, and ought to go bankrupt. Everybody ought to
            get what is coming to him.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">But I came here to say that I hoped you would not
            believe that I am what I appear to be in the pictures you make of
            me. I really am a pretty decent fellow! And I have a lot of emotions
            that do not show on the surface, and the things that I do not say
            would fill a library. The great curse of public life is that you are
            not allowed to say all the things that you think. Some of my
            opinions about some men are extremely picturesque, and if you could
            only take a motion picture of them, you would think it was Vesuvius
            in eruption. Yet all these volcanic forces, all these things that
            are going on inside of me, have to be concealed under a most grave
            and reverend exterior, and I have to make believe that I have
            nothing but respectable and solemn thoughts all the time. There is a
            lot going on inside of me that would be entertaining to any audience
            anywhere.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I am very much complimented that you should have
            allowed me to come in at this late hour in your feast and, without
            partaking of the pleasures of conversation, to make you all, whether
            you would or not, listen to me talk. My object in life is not
            talking. I wish there were less talking to do. I wish that not
            everybody had to be persuaded to do the right thing. I wish that the
            things that are obvious did not have to be explained. I wish that
            principles did not have to be re-expounded. We all in our hearts
            agree upon the fundamental principles of our lives and of our life
            as a nation; now we ought to tax ourselves with the duty of seeing
            that those principles are realized in action and no fooling about
            it. The only difficult things in life, ladies and gentlemen, are the
            applications of the principles of right and wrong. I can set forth
            the abstract principles of right and wrong, and so can you, but when
            it comes down to an individual item of conduct, whether in public
            affairs or in private affairs, there comes the pinch,—in the first
            place, to see the right way to do it; and, in the second place, to
            do it that way. If we could only agree that in all matters of public
            concern we would adjourn our private interests, look each other
            frankly in the face and say, “We are all ready at whatever sacrifice
            of our own interest to do in common the thing that the common weal
            demands,” what an irresistible force <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> would
            be! I can point out to you a few men,—of course, I am not going to
            name them now,—whom every man ought to <supplied reason="editoriallyadded" cert="somedoubt">be</supplied> afraid of, because
            nothing but the truth resides in them. I have one in particular in
            mind whom I have never caught thinking about himself. I would not
            dare make a pretense in the presence of that man even if I wanted
            to. His eyes contain the penetrating light of truth before which all
            disguises fall away.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Suppose we were all like that! It would hasten the
            millenium immensely. And if Americans were always to do what when
            the real temper of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> is aroused they do, the
            world would always turn to <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> for guidance and
               <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> would be the most potent and influential
            force in all the world. So that when I look at pictures, whether
            they move or whether they do not move, I think of all the deep
            sources of happiness and of pain, of joy and of misery, that lie
            beneath that surface, and I am interested chiefly in the heart that
            beats underneath it all. For I know that there is the pulse and the
            machinery of all the great forces of the world.</p>

         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Mr. <render as="smallcap" rend="inherit">Toastmaster and
            Gentlemen</render>:</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I have very little to say <word altform="tonight">to-night</word> except to express my warm appreciation of the
            invariable courtesy of this club and of the reception you have so
            generously accorded me. I find that I am seldom tempted to say
            anything nowadays unless somebody starts something, and <word altform="tonight">to-night</word> nobody has started anything.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Your talk, Mr. Toastmaster, has been a great deal
            about candidacy for the presidency. It is not a new feeling on my
            part, but one which I entertain with a greater intensity than
            formerly, that a man who seeks the Presidency of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United
               States</place> for anything that it will bring to him is an
            audacious fool. The responsibilities of the office ought to sober a
            man even before he approaches it. One of the difficulties of the
            office seldom appreciated, I dare say, is that it is very difficult
            to think while so many people are talking and particularly while so
            many people are talking in a way that obscures counsel and is
            entirely off the point.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The point in national affairs, gentlemen, never lies
            along the lines of expediency. It always rests in the field of
            principle. The <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> was not founded upon any
            principle of expediency; it was founded upon a profound principle of
            human liberty and of humanity, and whenever it bases its policy upon
            any other foundations than those it builds on the sand and not upon
            solid rock. It seems to me that the most enlightening thing a man
            can do is suggested by something which <personRef refurl="x4002314" reg="Thomas R. Marshall" link-pointer-type="person">the Vice
               President</personRef> said <word altform="tonight">to-night</word>. He complained that he found men who, when their
            attention was called to the signs of spring, did not see the blue
            heaven, did not see the movement of the free clouds, did not think
            of the great spaces of the quiet continent, but thought only of some
            immediate and pressing piece of business. It seems to me that if you
            do not think of the things that lie beyond and away from and
            disconnected from this scene in which we attempt to think and
            conclude, you will inevitably be led astray. I would a great deal
            rather know what they are talking about around quiet firesides all
            over this country than what they are talking about in the cloakrooms
            of Congress. I would a great deal rather know what the men on the
            trains and by the way-side and in the shops and on the farms are
            thinking about and yearning for than hear any of the vociferous
            proclamations of policy which it is so easy to hear and so easy to
            read by picking up any scrap of printed paper. There is only one way
            to hear these things, and that is constantly to go back to the
            fountains of American action. Those fountains are not to be found in
            any recently discovered sources.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve"><person refurl="x4002336" reg="Warren G. Harding" link-pointer-type="person">Senator Harding</person> was saying
            just now that we ought to try when we are a hundred million strong
            to act in the same simplicity of principle that our forefathers
            acted in when we were three million strong. I heard somebody say—I
            do not know the exact statistics—that the present population of the
               <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> is one hundred and three millions.
            If there are three million thinking the same things that that
            original three million thought, the hundred million will be saved
            for an illustrious future. They were ready to stake everything for
            an idea, and that idea was not expediency, but justice. And the
            infinite difficulty of public affairs, gentlemen, is not to discover
            the signs of the heavens and the directions of the wind, but to
            square the things you do by the not simple but complicated standards
            of justice. Justice has nothing to do with expediency. Justice has
            nothing to do with any temporary standard whatever. It is rooted and
            grounded in the fundamental instincts of humanity.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve"><place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> ought to keep out of this <word altform="World War I">war</word>. She ought to keep out of this
            war at the sacrifice of everything except this single thing upon
            which her character and history are founded, her sense of humanity
            and justice. If she sacrifices that, she has ceased to be
               <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place>; she has ceased to entertain and to love
            the traditions which have made us proud to be Americans, and when we
            go about seeking safety at the expense of humanity, then I for one
            will believe that I have always been mistaken in what I have
            conceived to be the spirit of American history.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">You never can tell your direction except by long
            measurements. You can not establish a line by two posts; you have
            got to have three at least to know whether they are straight with
            anything, and the longer your line the more certain your
            measurement. There is only one way in which to determine how the
            future of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> is going to be projected,
            and that is by looking back and seeing which way the lines ran which
            led up to the present moment of power and of opportunity. There is
            no doubt about that. There is no question what the roll of honor in
               <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> is. The roll of honor consists of the
            names of men who have squared their conduct by ideals of duty. There
            is no one else upon the roster; there is no one else whose name we
            care to remember when we measure things upon a national scale. And I
            wish that whenever an impulse of impatience comes upon us, whenever
            an impulse to settle a thing some short way tempts us, we might
            close the door and take down some old stories of what American
            idealists and statesmen did in the past, and not let any counsel in
            that does not sound in the authentic voice of American tradition.
            Then we shall be certain what the lines of the future are, because
            we shall know we are steering by the lines of the past. We shall
            know that no temporary convenience, no temporary expediency, will
            lead us either to be rash or to be cowardly. I would be just as much
            ashamed to be rash as I would to be a coward. Valor is
            self-respecting. Valor is circumspect. Valor strikes only when it is
            right to strike. Valor withholds itself from all small implications
            and entanglements and waits for the great opportunity when the sword
            will flash as if it carried the light of heaven upon its blade.</p>

         <p rend="noindent" xml:space="preserve"><render as="smallcap" rend="inherit">Gentlemen of the
            Congress</render>:</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">A situation has arisen in the foreign relations of the
            country of which it is my plain duty to inform you very frankly.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">It will be recalled that in <date value="1915-02-99">February, 1915</date>, the Imperial German Government announced
            its intention to treat the waters surrounding <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Great
            Britain</place> and <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Ireland</place> as embraced within the
            seat of war and to destroy all merchant ships owned by its enemies
            that might be found within any part of that portion of the high
            seas, and that it warned all vessels, of neutral as well as of
            belligerent ownership, to keep out of the waters it had thus
            proscribed or else enter them at their peril. The Government of the
               <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> earnestly protested. It took the
            position that such a policy could not be pursued without the
            practical certainty of gross and palpable violations of the law of
            nations, particularly if submarine craft were to be employed as its
            instruments, inasmuch as the rules prescribed by that law, rules
            founded upon principles of humanity and established for the
            protection of the lives of non-combatants at sea, could not in the
            nature of the case be observed by such vessels. It based its protest
            on the ground that persons of neutral nationality and vessels of
            neutral ownership would be exposed to extreme and intolerable risks,
            and that no right to close any part of the high seas against their
            use or to expose them to such risks could lawfully be asserted by
            any belligerent government. The law of nations in these matters,
            upon which the Government of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> based
            its protest, is not of recent origin or founded upon merely
            arbitrary principles set up by convention. It is based, on the
            contrary, upon manifest and imperative principles of humanity and
            has long been established with the approval and by the express
            assent of all civilized nations.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Notwithstanding the earnest protest of our Government,
            the Imperial German Government at once proceeded to carry out the
            policy it had announced. It expressed the hope that the dangers
            involved, at any rate the dangers to neutral vessels, would be
            reduced to a minimum by the instructions which it had issued to its
            submarine commanders, and assured the Government of the
               <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> that it would take every possible
            precaution both to respect the rights of neutrals and to safeguard
            the lives of non-combatants.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">What has actually happened in the year which has since
            elapsed has shown that those hopes were not justified, those
            assurances insusceptible of being fulfilled. In pursuance of the
            policy of submarine warfare against the commerce of its adversaries,
            thus announced and entered upon by the Imperial German Government in
            despite of the solemn protest of this Government, the commanders of
            German undersea vessels have attacked merchant ships with greater
            and greater activity, not only upon the high seas surrounding
               <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Great Britain</place> and <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Ireland</place> but
            wherever they could encounter them, in a way that has grown more and
            more ruthless, more and more indiscriminate as the months have gone
            by, less and less observant of restraints of any kind; and have
            delivered their attacks without compunction against vessels of every
            nationality and bound upon every sort of errand. Vessels of neutral
            ownership, even vessels of neutral ownership bound from neutral port
            to neutral port, have been destroyed along with vessels of
            belligerent ownership in constantly increasing numbers. Sometimes
            the merchantman attacked has been warned and summoned to surrender
            before being fired on or torpedoed; sometimes passengers or crews
            have been vouchsafed the poor security of being allowed to take to
            the ship’s boats before she was sent to the bottom. But again and
            again no warning has been given, no escape even to the ship’s boats
            allowed to those on board. What this Government foresaw must happen
            has happened. Tragedy has followed tragedy on the seas in such
            fashion, with such attendant circumstances, as to make it grossly
            evident that warfare of such a sort, if warfare it be, cannot be
            carried on without the most palpable violation of the dictates alike
            of right and of humanity. Whatever the disposition and intention of
            the Imperial German Government, it has manifestly proved impossible
            for it to keep such methods of attack upon the commerce of its
            enemies within the bounds set by either the reason or the heart of
            mankind.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">In February of the present year the Imperial German
            Government informed this Government and the other neutral
            governments of the world that it had reason to believe that the
            Government of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Great Britain</place> had armed all merchant
            vessels of British ownership and had given them secret orders to
            attack any submarine of the enemy they might encounter upon the
            seas, and that the Imperial German Government felt justified in the
            circumstances in treating all armed merchantmen of belligerent
            ownership as auxiliary vessels of war, which it would have the right
            to destroy without warning. The law of nations has long recognized
            the right of merchantmen to carry arms for protection and to use
            them to repel attack, though to use them, in such circumstances, at
            their own risk; but the Imperial German Government claimed the right
            to set these understandings aside in circumstances which it deemed
            extraordinary. Even the terms in which it announced its purpose thus
            still further to relax the restraints it had previously professed
            its willingness and desire to put upon the operations of its
            submarines carried the plain implication that at least vessels which
            were not armed would still be exempt from destruction without
            warning and that personal safety would be accorded their passengers
            and crews; but even that limitation, if it was ever practicable to
            observe it, has in fact constituted no check at all upon the
            destruction of ships of every sort.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Again and again the Imperial German Government has
            given this Government its solemn assurances that at least passenger
            ships would not be thus dealt with, and yet it has again and again
            permitted its undersea commanders to disregard those assurances with
            entire impunity. Great liners like the <name type="ship">
               <render as="italic" rend="inherit">Lusitania</render>
            </name> and the <name type="ship">
               <render as="italic" rend="inherit">Arabic</render>
            </name> and mere ferryboats like the <name type="ship">
               <render as="italic" rend="inherit">Sussex</render>
            </name> have been attacked without a moment’s warning, sometimes
            before they had even become aware that they were in the presence of
            an armed vessel of the enemy, and the lives of non-combatants,
            passengers and crew, have been sacrificed wholesale, in a manner
            which the Government of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> cannot but
            regard as wanton and without the slightest color of justification.
            No limit of any kind has in fact been set to the indiscriminate
            pursuit and destruction of merchantmen of all kinds and
            nationalities within the waters, constantly extending in area, where
            these operations have been carried on; and the roll of Americans who
            have lost their lives on ships thus attacked and destroyed has grown
            month by month until the ominous toll has mounted into the hundreds.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">One of the latest and most shocking instances of this
            method of warfare was that of the destruction of the French
            cross-Channel steamer <name type="ship">
               <render as="italic" rend="inherit">Sussex</render>
            </name>. It must stand forth, as the sinking of the steamer <name type="ship">
               <render as="italic" rend="inherit">Lusitania</render>
            </name> did, as so singularly tragical and unjustifiable as to
            constitute a truly terrible example of the inhumanity of submarine
            warfare as the commanders of German vessels have for the past
            twelvemonth been conducting it. If this instance stood alone, some
            explanation, some disavowal by the German Government, some evidence
            of criminal mistake or wilful disobedience on the part of the
            commander of the vessel that fired the torpedo might be sought or
            entertained; but unhappily it does not stand alone. Recent events
            make the conclusion inevitable that it is only one instance, even
            though it be one of the most extreme and distressing instances, of
            the spirit and method of warfare which the Imperial German
            Government has mistakenly adopted, and which from the first exposed
            that Government to the reproach of thrusting all neutral rights
            aside in pursuit of its immediate objects.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The Government of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> has
            been very patient. At every stage of this distressing experience of
            tragedy after tragedy in which its own citizens were involved it has
            sought to be restrained from any extreme course of action or of
            protest by a thoughtful consideration of the extraordinary
            circumstances of this unprecedented war, and actuated in all that it
            said or did by the sentiments of genuine friendship which the people
            of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> have always entertained and
            continue to entertain towards the German nation. It has of course
            accepted the successive explanations and assurances of the Imperial
            German Government as given in entire sincerity and good faith, and
            has hoped, even against hope, that it would prove to be possible for
            the German Government so to order and control the acts of its naval
            commanders as to square its policy with the principles of humanity
            as embodied in the law of nations. It has been willing to wait until
            the significance of the facts became absolutely unmistakable and
            susceptible of but one interpretation.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">That point has now unhappily been reached. The facts
            are susceptible of but one interpretation. The Imperial German
            Government has been unable to put any limits or restraints upon its
            warfare against either freight or passenger ships. It has therefore
            become painfully evident that the position which this Government
            took at the very outset is inevitable, namely, that the use of
            submarines for the destruction of an enemy’s commerce is of
            necessity, because of the very character of the vessels employed and
            the very methods of attack which their employment of course
            involves, incompatible with the principles of humanity, the long
            established and incontrovertible rights of neutrals, and the sacred
            immunities of non-combatants.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I have deemed it my duty, therefore, to say to the
            Imperial German Government that if it is still its purpose to
            prosecute relentless and indiscriminate warfare against vessels of
            commerce by the use of submarines, notwithstanding the now
            demonstrated impossibility of conducting that warfare in accordance
            with what the Government of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> must
            consider the sacred and indisputable rules of international law and
            the universally recognized dictates of humanity, the Government of
            the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> is at last forced to the conclusion
            that there is but one course it can pursue; and that unless the
            Imperial German Government should now immediately declare and effect
            an abandonment of its present methods of warfare against passenger
            and freight carrying vessels this Government can have no choice but
            to sever diplomatic relations with the Government of the
               <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">German Empire</place> altogether.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">This decision I have arrived at with the keenest
            regret; the possibility of the action contemplated I am sure all
            thoughtful Americans will look forward to with unaffected
            reluctance. But we cannot forget that we are in some sort and by the
            force of circumstances the responsible spokesmen of the rights of
            humanity, and that we cannot remain silent while those rights seem
            in process of being swept utterly away in the maelstrom of this
            terrible war. We owe it to a due regard for our own rights as a
            nation, to our sense of duty as a representative of the rights of
            neutrals the world over, and to a just conception of the rights of
            mankind to take this stand now with the utmost solemnity and
            firmness.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I have taken it, and taken it in the confidence that
            it will meet with your approval and support. All sober-minded men
            must unite in hoping that the Imperial German Government, which has
            in other circumstances stood as the champion of all that we are now
            contending for in the interest of humanity, may recognize the
            justice of our demands and meet them in the spirit in which they are
            made.</p>

            <render as="smallcap" rend="inherit">Mr. President and Gentlemen of the Press
            Club:</render>
         </p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I am both glad and sorry to be here; glad because I am
            always happy to be with you, and know and like so many of you, and
            sorry because I have to make a speech. One of the leading faults of
            you gentlemen of the press is your inordinate desire to hear other
            men talk, to draw them out upon all occasions, whether they wish to
            be drawn out or not. I remember being in this Press Club once
            before, making many unpremeditated disclosures of myself, and then
            having you with your singular instinct for publicity insist that I
            should give it away to everybody else.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I was thinking as I was looking forward to coming here
            this evening of that other occasion when I stood very nearly at the
            threshold of the duties that I have since been called upon to
            perform, and I was going over in my mind the impressions that I then
            had by way of forecast of the duties of President and comparing them
            with the experiences that have followed. I must say that the
            forecast has been very largely verified, and that the impressions I
            had then have been deepened rather than weakened.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">You may recall that I said then that I felt constantly
            a personal detachment from the Presidency; that one thing that I
            resented when I was not performing the duties of the office was
            being reminded that I was the President of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United
            States</place>. I felt toward it as a man feels toward a great
            function which, in working hours, he is obliged to perform, but
            which, out of working hours, he is glad to get away from and almost
            forget and resume the quiet course of his own thoughts. I am
            constantly reminded as I go about, as I do sometimes at the week
            end, of the personal inconvenience of being President of the
               <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place>. If I want to know how many people
            live in a small town all I have to do is to go there and they at
            once line up to be counted. I might, in a census-taking year, save
            the census takers a great deal of trouble by asking them to
            accompany me and count the people on the spot. Sometimes, when I am
            most beset, I seriously think of renting a pair of whiskers or of
            doing something else that will furnish me with an adequate disguise,
            because I am sorry to find that the cut of my jib is unmistakable
            and that I must sail under false colors if I am going to sail
            incognito.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Yet as I have matched my experiences with my
            anticipations, I, of course, have been aware that I was taken by
            surprise because of the prominence of many things to which I had not
            looked forward. When we are dealing with domestic affairs,
            gentlemen, we are dealing with things that to us as Americans are
            more or less calculable. There is a singular variety among our
            citizenship, it is true, a greater variety even than I had
            anticipated; but, after all, we are all steeped in the same
            atmosphere, we are all surrounded by the same environment, we are
            all more or less affected by the same traditions, and, moreover, we
            are working out something that has to be worked out among ourselves,
            and the elements are there to be dealt with at first hand. But when
            the fortunes of your own country are, so to say, subject to the
            incalculable winds of passion that are blowing through other parts
            of the world, then the strain is of a singular and unprecedented
            kind, because you do not know by what turn of the wheel of fortune
            the control of things is going to be taken out of your hand; it
            makes no difference how deep the passion of the Nation lies, that
            passion may be so overborne by the rush of fortune in circumstances
            like those which now exist that you feel the sort of—I had almost
            said resentment that a man feels when his own affairs are not within
            his own hands. You can imagine the strain upon the feeling of any
            man who is trying to interpret the spirit of his country when he
            feels that that spirit can not have its own way beyond a certain
            point. And one of the greatest points of strain upon me, if I may be
            permitted to point it out, was this:</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">There are two reasons why the chief wish of
               <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> is for peace. One is that they love peace
            and have nothing to do with the present quarrel; and the other is
            that they believe the present quarrel has carried those engaged in
            it so far that they can not be held to ordinary standards of
            responsibility, and that, therefore, as some men have expressed it
            to me, since the rest of the world is mad, why should we not simply
            refuse to have anything to do with the rest of the world in the
            ordinary channels of action? Why not let the storm pass, and then,
            when it is all over, have the reckonings? Knowing that from both
            these two points of view the passion of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> was
            for peace, I was, nevertheless, aware that <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> is
            one of the Nations of the world, not only, but one of the chief
            Nations of the world—a Nation that grows more and more powerful
            almost in spite of herself; that grows morally more and more
            influential even when she is not aware of it; and that if she is to
            play the part which she most covets, it is necessary that she should
            act more or less from the point of view of the rest of the world. If
            I can not retain my moral influence over a man except by
            occasionally knocking him down, if that is the only basis upon which
            he will respect me, then for the sake of his soul I have got
            occasionally to knock him down. You know how we have read in—isn’t
            it in <person link-pointer-type="person">Ralph Connor’s</person> stories of western life in
               <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Canada</place>?—that all his sky pilots are ready for a
            fracas at any time, and how the ultimate salvation of the souls of
            their parishioners depends upon their using their fists
            occasionally. If a man will not listen to you quietly in a seat, sit
            on his neck and make him listen; just as I have always maintained,
            particularly in view of certain experiences of mine, that the
            shortest road to a boy’s moral sense is through his cuticle. There
            is a direct and, if I may be permitted the pun, a fundamental
            connection between the surface of his skin and his moral
            consciousness. You arrest his attention first in that way, and then
            get the moral lesson conveyed to him in milder ways that, if he were
            grown up, would be the only ways you would use.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">So I say that I have been aware that in order to do
            the very thing that we are proudest of the ability to do, there
            might come a time when we would have to do it in a way that we would
            prefer not to do it; and the great burden on my spirits, gentlemen,
            has been that it has been up to me to choose when that time came.
            Can you imagine a thing more calculated to keep a man awake at
            nights than that? Because, just because I did not feel that I was
            the whole thing and was aware that my duty was a duty of
            interpretation, how could I be sure that I had the right elements of
            information by which to interpret truly?</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">What we are now talking about is largely spiritual.
            You say, “All the people out my way think so and so.” Now, I know
            perfectly well that you have not talked with all the people out your
            way. I find that out again and again. And so you are taken by
            surprise. The people of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> are not
            asking anybody’s leave to do their own thinking, and are not asking
            anybody to tip them off what they ought to think. They are thinking
            for themselves, every man for himself; and you do not know, and, the
            worst of it is, since the responsibility is mine, I do not know what
            they are thinking about. I have the most imperfect means of finding
            out, and yet I have got to act as if I knew. That is the burden of
            it, and I tell you, gentlemen, it is a pretty serious burden,
            particularly if you look upon the office as I do—that I am not put
            here to do what I please. If I were, it would have been very much
            more interesting than it has been. I am put here to interpret, to
            register, to suggest, and, more than that, and much greater than
            that, to be suggested to.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Now, that is where the experience that I forecast has
            differed from the experience that I have had. In domestic matters I
            think I can in most cases come pretty near a guess where the thought
            of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> is going, but in foreign affairs the chief
            element is where action is going on in other quarters of the world
            and not where thought is going in the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place>.
            Therefore, I have several times taken the liberty of urging upon you
            gentlemen not yourselves to know more than the State Department
            knows about foreign affairs. Some of you have shown a singular range
            of omniscience, and certain things have been reported as understood
            in administrative circles which I never heard of until I read the
            newspapers. I am constantly taken by surprise in regard to decisions
            which are said to be my own, and this gives me an uncomfortable
            feeling that some providence is at work with which I have had no
            communication at all. Now, that is pretty dangerous, gentlemen,
            because it happens that remarks start fires. There is tinder lying
            everywhere, not only on the other side of the water, but on this
            side of the water, and a man that spreads sparks may be responsible
            for something a great deal worse than burning a town on the Mexican
            border. Thoughts may be bandits. Thoughts may be raiders. Thoughts
            may be invaders. Thoughts may be disturbers of international peace;
            and when you reflect upon the importance of this country keeping out
            of the present war, you will know what tremendous elements we are
            all dealing with. We are all in the same boat. If somebody does not
            keep the processes of peace going, if somebody does not keep their
            passions disengaged, by what impartial judgment and suggestion is
            the world to be aided to a solution when the whole thing is over? If
            you are in a conference in which you know nobody is disinterested,
            how are you going to make a plan? I tell you this gentlemen, the
            only thing that saves the world is the little handful of
            disinterested men that are in it.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Now, I have found a few disinterested men. I wish I
            had found more. I can name two or three men with whom I have
            conferred again and again and again, and I have never caught them by
            an inadvertance thinking about themselves for their own interests,
            and I tie to those men as you would tie to an anchor. I tie to them
            as you would tie to the voices of conscience if you could be sure
            that you always heard them. Men who have no axes to grind! Men who
            love <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> so that they would give their lives for
            it and never care whether anybody heard that they had given their
            lives for it; willing to die in obscurity if only they might serve!
            Those are the men, and nations like those men are the nations that
            are going to serve the world and save it. There never was a time in
            the history of the world when character, just sheer character all by
            itself, told more than it does now. A friend of mine says that every
            man who takes office in <place reg="Washington, DC" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Washington</place> either grows or swells, and when I give a man an
            office, I watch him carefully to see whether he is swelling or
            growing. The mischief of it is that when they swell they do not
            swell enough to burst. If they would only swell to the point where
            you might insert a pin and let the gases out, it would be a great
            delight. I do not know any pastime that would be more diverting,
            except that the gases are probably poisonous so that we would have
            to stand from under. But the men who grow, the men who think better
            a year after they are put in office than they thought when they were
            put in office, are the balance wheel of the whole thing. They are
            the ballast that enables the craft to carry sail and to make port in
            the long run, no matter what the weather is.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">So I have come willing to make this narrative of
            experience to you. I have come through the fire since I talked to
            you last. Whether the metal is purer than it was, God only knows;
            but the fire has been there, the fire has penetrated every part of
            it, and if I may believe my own thoughts I have less partisan
            feeling, more impatience of party maneuver, more enthusiasm for the
            right thing, no matter whom it hurts, than I ever had before in my
            life. And I have something that it is no doubt dangerous to have,
            but that I can not help having. I have a profound intellectual
            contempt for men who can not see the signs of the times. I have to
            deal with some men who know no more of the modern processes of
            politics than if they were living in the eighteenth century, and for
            them I have a profound and comprehensive intellectual contempt. They
            are blind. They are hopelessly blind; and the worst of it is I have
            to spend hours of my time talking to them when I know before I start
            as much as after I have finished that it is absolutely useless to
            talk to them. I am talking <render as="italic" rend="inherit">in vacuo</render>.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The business of every one of us, gentlemen, is to
            realize that if we are correspondents of papers who have not yet
            heard of modern times we ought to send them as many intimations of
            modern movements as they are willing to print. There is a simile
            that was used by a very interesting English writer that has been
            much in my mind. Like myself, he had often been urged not to try to
            change so many things. I remember when I was president of <placeRef reg="Princeton University" link-pointer-type="place">a university</placeRef> a man said to
            me, “Good heavens, man, why don’t you leave something alone and let
            it stay the way it is?” And I said, “If you will guarantee to me
            that it will stay the way it is I will let it alone; but if you knew
            anything you would know that if you leave a live thing alone it will
            not stay where it is. It will develop and will either go in the
            wrong direction or decay.” I reminded him of this thing that the
            English writer said, that if you want to keep a white post white you
            can not let it alone. It will get black. You have to keep doing
            something to it. In that instance you have got to keep painting it
            white, and you have got to paint it white very frequently in order
            to keep it white, because there are forces at work that will get the
            better of you. Not only will it turn black, but the forces of
            moisture and the other forces of nature will penetrate the white
            paint and get at the fiber of the wood, and decay will set in, and
            the next time you try to paint it you will find that there is
            nothing but punk to paint. Then you will remember the Red Queen in
            “Alice in Wonderland,” or “Alice Through the Looking Glass”—I forget
            which, it has been so long since I read them—who takes Alice by the
            hand and they rush along at a great pace, and then when they stop
            Alice looks around and says, “But we are just where we were when we
            started.” “Yes,” says the Red Queen, “you have to run twice as fast
            as that to get anywhere else.”</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">That is also true, gentlemen, of the world and of
            affairs. You have got to run fast merely to stay where you are, and
            in order to get anywhere, you have got to run twice as fast as that.
            That is what people do not realize. That is the mischief of these
            hopeless dams against the stream known as reactionaries and
            standpatters, and other words of obloquy. That is what is the matter
            with them; they are not even staying where they were. They are
            sinking further and further back in what will sometime comfortably
            close over their heads as the black waters of oblivion. I sometimes
            imagine that I see their heads going down, and I am not inclined
            even to throw them a life preserver. The sooner they disappear, the
            better. We need their places for people who are awake; and we
            particularly need now, gentlemen, men who will divest themselves of
            party passion and of personal preference and will try to think in
            the terms of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place>. If a man describes himself to
            me now in any other terms than those terms, I am not sure of him;
            and I love the fellows that come into my office sometimes and say,
            “Mr. President, I am an American.” Their hearts are right, their
            instinct true, they are going in the right direction, and will take
            the right leadership if they believe that the leader is also a man
            who thinks first of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place>.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">You will see, gentlemen, that I did not premeditate
            these remarks, or they would have had some connection with each
            other. They would have had some plan. I have merely given myself the
            pleasure of telling you what has really been in my heart, and not
            only has been in my heart but is in my heart every day of the week.
            If I did not go off at week ends occasionally and throw off, as much
            as it is possible to throw off, this burden, I could not stand it.
            This week I went down the Potomac and up the James and substituted
            history for politics, and there was an infinite, sweet calm in some
            of those old places that reminded me of the records that were made
            in the days that are past; and I comforted myself with the
            recollection that the men we remember are the disinterested men who
            gave us the deeds that have covered the name of
            <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> all over with the luster of imperishable
            glory.</p>

         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">When the invitation to be here <word altform="tonight">to-night</word> came to me, I was glad to accept it,—not because
            it offered me an opportunity to discuss the <word altform="program">programme</word> of the League,—that you will, I am sure, not
            expect of me,—but because the desire of the whole world now turns
            eagerly, more and more eagerly, towards the hope of peace, and there
            is just reason why we should take our part in counsel upon this
            great theme. It is right that I, as spokesman of our Government,
            should attempt to give expression to what I believe to be the
            thought and purpose of the people of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United
            States</place> in this vital matter.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">This <abbr expan="World War I">great war</abbr> that
            broke so suddenly upon the world two years ago, and which has swept
            within its flame so great a part of the civilized world, has
            affected us very profoundly, and we are not only at liberty, it is
            perhaps our duty, to speak very frankly of it and of the great
            interests of civilization which it affects.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">With its causes and its objects we are not concerned.
            The obscure fountains from which its stupendous flood has burst
            forth we are not interested to search for or explore. But so great a
            flood, spread far and wide to every quarter of the globe, has of
            necessity engulfed many a fair province of right that lies very near
            to us. Our own rights as a Nation, the liberties, the privileges,
            and the property of our people have been profoundly affected. We are
            not mere disconnected lookers-on. The longer the war lasts, the more
            deeply do we become concerned that it should be brought to an end
            and the world be permitted to resume its normal life and course
            again. And when it does come to an end we shall be as much concerned
            as the nations at war to see peace assume an aspect of permanence,
            give promise of days from which the anxiety of uncertainty shall be
            lifted, bring some assurance that peace and war shall always
            hereafter be reckoned part of the common interest of mankind. We are
            participants, whether we would or not, in the life of the world. The
            interests of all nations are our own also. We are partners with the
            rest. What affects mankind is inevitably our affair as well as the
            affair of the nations of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Europe</place> and of
            <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Asia</place>.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">One observation on the causes of the present war we
            are at liberty to make, and to make it may throw some light forward
            upon the future, as well as backward upon the past. It is plain that
            this war could have come only as it did, suddenly and out of secret
            counsels, without warning to the world, without discussion, without
            any of the deliberate movements of counsel with which it would seem
            natural to approach so stupendous a contest. It is probable that if
            it had been foreseen just what would happen, just what alliances
            would be formed, just what forces arrayed against one another, those
            who brought the great contest on would have been glad to substitute
            conference for force. If we ourselves had been afforded some
            opportunity to apprise the belligerents of the attitude which it
            would be our duty to take, of the policies and practices against
            which we would feel bound to use all our moral and economic
            strength, and in certain circumstances even our physical strength
            also, our own contribution to the counsel which might have averted
            the struggle would have been considered worth weighing and
            regarding.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">And the lesson which the shock of being taken by
            surprise in a matter so deeply vital to all the nations of the world
            has made poignantly clear is, that the peace of the world must
            henceforth depend upon a new and more wholesome diplomacy. Only when
            the great nations of the world have reached some sort of agreement
            as to what they hold to be fundamental to their common interest, and
            as to some feasible method of acting in concert when any nation or
            group of nations seeks to disturb those fundamental things, can we
            feel that civilization is at last in a way of justifying its
            existence and claiming to be finally established. It is clear that
            nations must in the future be governed by the same high code of
            honor that we demand of individuals.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">We must, indeed, in the very same breath with which we
            avow this conviction admit that we have ourselves upon occasion in
            the past been offenders against the law of diplomacy which we thus
            forecast; but our conviction is not the less clear, but rather the
            more clear, on that account. If this war has accomplished nothing
            else for the benefit of the world, it has at least disclosed a great
            moral necessity and set forward the thinking of the statesmen of the
            world by a whole age. Repeated utterances of the leading statesmen
            of most of the great nations now engaged in war have made it plain
            that their thought has come to this, that the principle of public
            right must henceforth take precedence over the individual interests
            of particular nations, and that the nations of the world must in
            some way band themselves together to see that that right prevails as
            against any sort of selfish aggression; that henceforth alliance
            must not be set up against alliance, understanding against
            understanding, but that there must be a common agreement for a
            common object, and that at the heart of that common object must lie
            the inviolable rights of peoples and of mankind. The nations of the
            world have become each other’s neighbors. It is to their interest
            that they should understand each other. In order that they may
            understand each other, it is imperative that they should agree to
            cooperate in a common cause, and that they should so act that the
            guiding principle of that common cause shall be even-handed and
            impartial justice.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">This is undoubtedly the thought of
            <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place>. This is what we ourselves will say when
            there comes proper occasion to say it. In the dealings of nations
            with one another arbitrary force must be rejected and we must move
            forward to the thought of the modern world, the thought of which
            peace is the very atmosphere. That thought constitutes a chief part
            of the passionate conviction of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place>.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">We believe these fundamental things: First, that every
            people has a right to choose the sovereignty under which they shall
            live. Like other nations, we have ourselves no doubt once and again
            offended against that principle when for a little while controlled
            by selfish passion, as our franker historians have been honorable
            enough to admit; but it has become more and more our rule of life
            and action. Second, that the small states of the world have a right
            to enjoy the same respect for their sovereignty and for their
            territorial integrity that great and powerful nations expect and
            insist upon. And, third, that the world has a right to be free from
            every disturbance of its peace that has its origin in aggression and
            disregard of the rights of peoples and nations.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">So sincerely do we believe in these things that I am
            sure that I speak the mind and wish of the people of
            <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> when I say that the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United
            States</place> is willing to become a partner in any feasible
            association of nations formed in order to realize these objects and
            make them secure against violation.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">There is nothing that the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place>
            wants for itself that any other nation has. We are willing, on the
            contrary, to limit ourselves along with them to a prescribed course
            of duty and respect for the rights of others which will check any
            selfish passion of our own, as it will check any aggressive impulse
            of theirs.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">If it should ever be our privilege to suggest or
            initiate a movement for peace among the nations now at war, I am
            sure that the people of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> would wish
            their Government to move along these lines: First, such a settlement
            with regard to their own immediate interests as the belligerents may
            agree upon. We have nothing material of any kind to ask for
            ourselves, and are quite aware that we are in no sense or degree
            parties to the present quarrel. Our interest is only in peace and
            its future guarantees. Second, an universal association of the
            nations to maintain the inviolate security of the highway of the
            seas for the common and unhindered use of all the nations of the
            world, and to prevent any war begun either contrary to treaty
            covenants or without warning and full submission of the causes to
            the opinion of the world,—a virtual guarantee of territorial
            integrity and political independence.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">But I did not come here, let me repeat, to discuss a
               <word altform="program">programme</word>. I came only to avow a
            creed and give expression to the confidence I feel that the world is
            even now upon the eve of a great consummation, when some common
            force will be brought into existence which shall safeguard right as
            the first and most fundamental interest of all peoples and all
            governments, when coercion shall be summoned not to the service of
            political ambition or selfish hostility, but to the service of a
            common order, a common justice, and a common peace. God grant that
            the dawn of that day of frank dealing and of settled peace, concord,
            and cooperation may be near at hand!</p>

         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Mr. Secretary, Ladies, and Gentlemen: I have not come
            here this afternoon with the purpose of delivering to you an
            elaborate address. It seems to me that the day is sufficiently
            eloquent already with the meaning which it should convey to us. The
            spectacle of the morning has been a very moving spectacle indeed—an
            almost unpremeditated outpouring of thousands of sober citizens to
            manifest their interest in the safety of the country and the
            sacredness of the flag which is its emblem.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I need not remind you how much sentiment has been
            poured out in honor of the flag of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place>.
            Sometimes we have been charged with being a very sentimental people,
            fond of expressing in general rhetorical phrases principles not
            sufficiently defined in action, and I dare say there have been times
            of happy and careless ease in this country when all that it has been
            necessary to do for the honor of the flag was to put our sentiments
            into poetic expressions, into the words that for the time being
            satisfied our hearts.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">But this is not a day of sentiment. Sentiment is a
            propulsive power, but it does not propel in the way that is
            serviceable to the Nation, unless it have a definite purpose before
            it. This is not merely a day of sentiment. It is a day of purpose.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">It is an eloquent symbol of the unity of our history
            that upon this monument which commemorates the man who did most to
            establish the American Union we should have hoisted those stars that
            have so multiplied since his time, associated with those lines of
            red and white, which mean all that is pure in our purpose and all
            that is red in our blood in the service of a Nation whose history
            has been full of inspiration because of his example.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">But <person refurl="x4000491" reg="George Washington" link-pointer-type="person">Washington</person> was one of the
            least sentimental men that <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> has ever produced.
            The thing that thrills me about <person refurl="x4000491" reg="George Washington" link-pointer-type="person">Washington</person> is that he is impatient of any sentiment that
            has not got definite purpose in it. His letters run along the lines
            of action, not merely along the mere lines of sentiment, and the
            most inspiring times that this Nation has ever seen have been the
            times when sentiment had to be translated into action.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Apparently this Nation is again and again and again to
            be tested, and always tested in the same way. The last supreme test
            that this Nation went through was the test of the Civil War.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">You know how deep that cut. You know what exigent
            issues of life were at issue in that struggle. You know how two
            great sections of this Union seemed to be moving in opposite
            directions, and for a long time it was questionable whether that
            flag represented any one united purpose in <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place>.
            And you know how deep that struggle cut into the sentiments of this
            people and how there came a whole generation following that great
            struggle when men’s hearts were bitter and sore and memories hurt as
            well as exalted, and how it seemed as if a rift had come in the
            hearts of the people of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place>.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">And you know how that ended. While it seemed a time of
            terror, it has turned out a proof of the validity of our hope. Where
            are now the divisions of sentiment which cut us asunder at the time
            of the Civil War? Did you not see the blue and the gray mingled this
            morning in the procession? Did not you see the sons of a subsequent
            generation walking together in happy comradeship? Was there any
            contradiction of feeling or division of sentiment evident there for
            a moment?</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Nothing cuts so deep as a civil war, and yet all the
            wounds of that war have been healed not only, but the very passion
            of that war seems to have contributed to the strength of national
            feeling which now moves us as a single body politic.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">And yet again the test is applied, my fellow
            countrymen, a new sort of division of feeling has sprung up amongst
            us. You know that we are derived in our citizenship from every
            nation in the world. It is not singular that sentiment should be
            disturbed by what is going on on the other side of the water, but
            while sentiment may be disturbed, loyalty ought not to be.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I want to be scrupulously just, my fellow citizens, in
            assuming the circumstances of this day, and I am sure that you wish
            with me to deal out with an even hand the praise and the blame of
            this day of test.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I believe that the vast majority of those men whose
            lineage is directly derived from the nations now at war are just as
            loyal to the flag of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> as any native
            citizen of this beloved land, but there are some men of that
            extraction who are not; and they, not only in past months, but at
            the present time, are doing their best to undermine the influence of
            the Government of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> in the interest
            of matters which are foreign to us and which are not derived from
            the questions of our own politics.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">There is disloyalty active in the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United
            States</place>, and it must be absolutely crushed. It proceeds from
            a minority, a very small minority, but a very active and subtle
            minority. It works underground, but it also shows its ugly head
            where we can see it; and there are those at this moment who are
            trying to levy a species of political blackmail, saying, “Do what we
            wish in the interest of foreign sentiment or we will wreak our
            vengeance at the polls.”</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">That is the sort of thing against which the American
            Nation will turn with a might and triumph of sentiment which will
            teach these gentlemen once for all that loyalty to this flag is the
            first test of tolerance in the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place>.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">That is the lesson that I have come to remind you of
            on this day—no mere sentiment. It runs into your daily life and
            conversation. Are you going yourselves, individually and
            collectively, to see to it that no man is tolerated who does not do
            honor to that flag?</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">It is not a matter of force. It is not a matter, that
            is to say, of physical force. It is a matter of a greater force than
            that which is physical. It is a matter of spiritual force. It is to
            be achieved as we think, as we purpose, as we believe, and when the
            world finally learns that <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> is indivisible,
            then the world will learn how truly and profoundly great and
            powerful <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> is.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I realize personally, my fellow citizens, that
            peculiar significance of the flag of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United
            States</place> at this time, because there was a day not many years
            ago when, although I knew what that flag stood for, it had not
            penetrated my whole consciousness as it has now.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">If you could have gone with me through the space of
            the last two years, and could have felt the subtle impact of
            intrigue and sedition and have realized with me that those to whom
            you have intrusted authority are trustees, not only of the power,
            but of the very spirit and purpose of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United
            States</place>, you would realize with me the solemnity with which I
            look upon that sublime symbol of our unity and power.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I want you to share that consciousness with me. I want
            you to realize that in what I am saying I am merely your spokesman,
            merely trying to interpret your thoughts, merely trying to put into
            inadequate words the purpose that is in your hearts. I regard this
            day as a day of rededication to all the ideals of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United
               States</place>.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I took the liberty a few weeks ago to ask our fellow
            citizens all over the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> to gather
            together in celebration of this day, the anniversary of the adoption
            of our present flag as the emblem of the Nation. I had no legal
            right to declare it a holiday, I had no legal right to ask for the
            cessation of business, but when you read in the papers <word altform="tomorrow">to-morrow</word> morning I think you will see
            that authority was not necessary; that the people of the country
            were waiting for an opportunity to cease their ordinary business and
            gather together in united demonstration of their feeling as a
            Nation.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">It was a very happy thought that led the committee of
            gentlemen who had charge of the demonstration of the forenoon to
            choose the <date value="1916-06-14">14th of June</date> for the
            parade which most of use have witnessed. It is a tiresome thing, my
            fellow citizens, to stand for hours and see a parade go by, but I
            want to take you into this secret: It was not half as tiresome as
            the inauguration parade.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The inauguration parade is a very interesting thing,
            but it is painfully interesting to the man who is being inaugurated,
            because there then lie ahead of him the four years of responsibility
            whose horoscope can not be cast by any man.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">But to-day was interesting, because the inauguration
            parade of the day of my inauguration is more than three years gone
            by. I have gone through deep waters with you in the meantime.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">This parade was not a demonstration in honor of any
            man. It was an outpouring of people to demonstrate a great national
            sentiment. I was not the object of it. I was one citizen among
            millions whose heart beat in unison with it.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I felt caught up and buoyed along by the great stream
            of human purpose which seemed to flow there in front of me by the
            stand by the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">White House</place>, and I shall go away from

         <p rend="noindent" xml:space="preserve">Mr. <render as="smallcap" rend="inherit">President, Gentlemen of
               the Associated Advertising Clubs, Ladies and Gentlemen</render>:</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">You will understand that I have not come here to make
            an extended address. I do not need to explain to you the
            circumstances which have made it impossible that I should prepare an
            extended address, but I count myself very fortunate to be able to
            leave my duties at <place reg="Washington, DC" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Washington</place>
            long enough to face this interesting company of men who have the
            very fine conception that it is their duty to lift the standards and
            ideals of their profession.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I understand, gentlemen, that you have associated
            yourselves together in order to promote candor and truth in the
            advertisement of your business. I wish very much, gentlemen, that
            candor and truth might always be the standard of politics as well as
            the standard of business. I want to challenge your attention for a
            moment to this aspect of your activities. I do not see how a man can
            devote himself to candor and truth in the promotion of a particular
            business without studying the life of the great nation to whom he
            addresses his advertising. I do not see how a man can fail, having
            established the horizon of his business where the great hills of
            truth lie, to lift his eyes to the great multitude of laboring men
            and striving women who constitute a great nation like ours, and in
            the very act of addressing them get in his own consciousness some
            part of the impulse of their life. You can not commend your business
            to people that you do not understand, and you can not understand the
            people of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> without wishing to serve
            them.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">So I come to you with this thought:
            <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> is at a point, gentlemen, where it is more
            than ever necessary that she should understand her own ideals not
            only, but be ready to put them into action at any cost. It is one
            thing to entertain fine principles and another thing to make them
            work. It is one thing to entertain them in the formulæ of words like
            the splendid words which were uttered and gave distinction to this
            ancient and historic building behind me, but it is another thing to
            do what those same men did, make those words live in the action of
            their lives. And <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> is summoned in each new
            generation to renew not only the pledges that those men made, but to
            renew the example which they gave to the world.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I am not interested, and I beg that you will believe
            me when I say that I never have been interested, in fighting for
            myself, but I am immensely interested in fighting for the things
            that I believe in, and so far as they are concerned I am a
            challenger to all comers. It is important, therefore, since I am in
            fighting mood, to let you know what are some of the things that I do
            believe in.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">In the first place, I believe, and I summon you to
            show your belief in the same thing, that it is the duty of every
            American in everything that he does, in his business and out of it,
            to think first, not of himself or of any interest which he may be
            called upon to sacrifice, but of the country which we serve.
               “<place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> first” means nothing until you translate
            it into what you do. So I believe most profoundly in the duty of
            every American to exalt the national consciousness by purifying his
            own motives and exhibiting his own devotion.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I believe, in the second place, that
            <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place>, the country that we put first in our
            thoughts, should be ready in every point of policy and of action to
            vindicate at whatever cost the principles of liberty, of justice,
            and of humanity to which we have been devoted from the first.
            [Cheers.] You cheer the sentiment, but do you realize what it means?
            It means that you have not only got to be just to your fellow men,
            but that as a nation you have got to be just to other nations. It
            comes high. It is not an easy thing to do. It is easy to think first
            of the material interest of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place>, but it is not
            easy to think first of what <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place>, if she loves
            justice, ought to do in the field of international affairs. I
            believe that at whatever cost <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> should be just
            to other peoples and treat other peoples as she demands that they
            should treat her. She has a right to demand that they treat her with
            justice and respect, and she has a right to insist that they treat
            her in that fashion, but she can not with dignity or with
            self-respect insist upon that unless she is willing to act in the
            same fashion toward them. That I am ready to fight for at any cost
            to myself.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Then, in the third place, touching ourselves more
            intimately, my fellow citizens, this is what I believe: If I
            understand the life of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place>, the central principle
            of it is this, that no small body of persons, no matter how
            influential, shall be trusted to determine the policy and
            development of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place>. You know what you want in
            your business. You want a fair field and no favor. You want to be
            given the same opportunity that other men have, not only to make
            known what you have to sell, but to sell it under as favorable
            conditions as anybody else. The principle of the life of
               <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> is that she draws her vitality, not from
            small bodies of men who may wish to assume the responsibility of
            guiding and controlling her, but from the great body of thinking and
            toiling and planning men from whom she draws her energy and vitality
            as a nation. I believe, and this is the reason I am a Democrat, not
            merely with a big “D” but with a little “d”—I am all kinds of a
            democrat, so far as I can discover—but the root of the whole
            business is this, that I believe in the patriotism and energy and
            initiative of the average man. Some men say they believe in it, but
            when they act, they show that they do not. They show that they think
            the only advice that it is safe to take is their advice. [Voice in
            crowd: “Oh, you <person refurl="x4005085" reg="Theodore Roosevelt" link-pointer-type="person">Teddy</person>!”]</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I was not referring to any individual, but I could
            give you an interesting and a very short list of a group of
            individuals who have that opinion, namely, that it is not safe for
            the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> to escape from their control. I
            feel perfectly safe in the hands of the average body of my fellow
            citizens. You are bound to feel safe in their hands. If they do not
            believe in you, you can not sell anything. If they do not believe in
            you, you can not conduct your business. Your vitality comes from
            them to you; it does not go from you to them. The theory of
            government which I decline to subscribe to is that the vitality of
            the nation comes out of closeted councils where a few men determine
            the policy of the country.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">So, gentlemen, I feel at home in this company, not
            because I advertise, but because I have got principles that I am
            perfectly willing to expose to the public view, and because I want
            to express my sympathy with, not only, but my admiration for a body
            of men who think it is worth while to get together in order to tell
            the truth. The only thing that ever set any man free, the only thing
            that ever set any nation free, is the truth. A man that is afraid of
            the truth is afraid of the law of life. A man that does not love the
            truth is in the way of decay and of failure, and I believe that if
            you will just let the vitality that is in you and the enthusiasm
            that is in you run beyond the confines of the businesses that you
            may be interested in, you will presently feel that infinite reward,
            as if the red blood of a whole nation came surging back into your
            own veins.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Can you imagine, my fellow countrymen, a more
            inspiring thing than to belong to a free nation and make your way
            among men everyone of whom has the right and the opportunity to say
            what he thinks. Criticism does not hurt anybody. I heard an old
            politician once say to his son, “John, don’t bother your head about
            lies and slanders; they will take care of themselves, but if you
            ever hear me denying anything, you may make up your mind that it is
            so.” When you see a man wincing under criticism, you may know that
            something hit him that was so. And, therefore, when they are saying
            the things that are not true, there is no credit in keeping your
            head and not minding it. I have such an inveterate confidence in the
            ultimate triumph of the truth that I feel, with old <person link-pointer-type="person">Doctor
               Oliver Wendell Holmes</person>, that the truth is no invalid, and
            you need not mind how roughly you handle her. She has got a splendid
            constitution and she will survive every trial and every labor.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I have come, therefore, as I have abundantly shown
            you, not to make a formal speech—if I could show you some of the
            things I have been obliged to do before I came here, you would know
            that I could not possibly make up a speech—but merely to show my
            profound interest in a body of men who are not only devoted to
            business but devoted to ideals. Business is all right so long as it
            is not sordid, and it cannot be sordid if it is shot through with
            ideals. A man, no matter how humble his business, can hold his head
            up among the princes of the world if, as they ought to do, he will
            think of himself as the servant of the people and not as their
            master, as one who would serve and not as one who would govern.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I congratulate you, my fellow citizens, upon the
            ideals of a profession which can lower or exalt business, as you
            choose, and which you have chosen to employ for its exaltation. I
            came away from <place reg="Washington, DC" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Washington</place> to
            look into your faces and get some of the enthusiasm which I always
            get when I come away from officialdom and touch hand to hand with
            great bodies of the free American people.</p>

         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I realize that I have done a very imprudent thing; I
            have come to address this thoughtful company of men without any
            preparation whatever. If I could have written as witty a speech as
               <person refurl="x4002953" reg="Ralph Pulitzer" link-pointer-type="person">Mr. Pulitzer</person>, I would have
            written it. If I could have written as clear an enunciation of the
            fundamental ideals of American patriotism as the mayor, I should
            have attempted it. If I could have been as appealing a person and of
            as feeling a heart as <person link-pointer-type="person">Mr. Cobb</person>, I would have felt
            safe.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">If I could have been as generous and interesting and
            genuine as <person link-pointer-type="person">Mr. Colby</person>, I should have felt that I
            could let myself go without any preparation. But, gentlemen, as a
            matter of fact, I have been absorbed by the responsibilities which
            have been so frequently referred to here <word altform="tonight">to-night</word>, and that preoccupation has made it impossible
            for me to forecast even what you would like to hear me talk about.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">There is something very oddly contradictory about the
            effect you men have on me. You are sometimes, particularly in your
            photographic enterprises, very brutal to me, and you sometimes
            invade my privacy, even to the extent of formulating my judgments
            before they are formed, and yet I am tempted when I stand face to
            face with you to take off all guard and merely expose myself to you
            as the fallible human being that I am.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve"><person link-pointer-type="person">Mr. Colby</person> said something that was
            among the few things I had forecast to say myself. He said that
            there are certain things which really it is useless to debate,
            because they go as a matter of course.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Of course it is our duty to prepare this Nation to
            take care of its honor and of its institutions. Why debate any part
            of that, except the detail, except the plan itself, which is always
            debatable?</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Of course it is the duty of the Government, which it
            will never overlook, to defend the territory and people of this
            country. It goes without saying that it is the duty of the
            administration to have constantly in mind with the utmost
            sensitiveness every point of national honor.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">But, gentlemen, after you have said and accepted these
            obvious things your program of action is still to be formed. When
            will you act and how will you act?</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The easiest thing is to strike. The brutal thing is
            the impulsive thing. No man has to think before he takes aggressive
            action; but before a man really conserves the honor by realizing the
            ideals of the Nation he has to think exactly what he will do and how
            he will do it.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Do you think the glory of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> would
            be enhanced by a war of conquest in <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Mexico</place>? Do you
            think that any act of violence by a powerful nation like this
            against a weak and distracted neighbor would reflect distinction
            upon the annals of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place>?</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Do you think that it is our duty to carry self-defense
            to the point of dictation in the affairs of another people? The
            ideals of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> are written plain upon every page
            of American history.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">And I want you to know how fully I realize whose
            servant I am. I do not own the Government of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United
               States</place>, even for the time being. I have no right in the
            use of it to express my own passions.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I have no right to express my own ambitions for the
            development of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> if those ambitions are not
            coincident with the ambitions of the Nation itself.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">And I have constantly to remind myself that I am not
            the servant of those who wish to enhance the value of their Mexican
            investments, but that I am the servant of the rank and file of the
            people of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place>.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I get a great many letters, my fellow citizens, from
            important and influential men in this country, but I get a great
            many other letters. I get letters from unknown men, from humble
            women, from people whose names have never been heard and will never
            be recorded, and there is but one prayer in all of these letters:
               “<personRef refurl="x4000418" reg="Woodrow Wilson" link-pointer-type="person">Mr. President</personRef>, do not
            allow anybody to persuade you that the people of this country want
            war with anybody.”</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I got off a train yesterday, and as I was bidding
            good-by to the engineer he said, in an undertone, “<personRef refurl="x4000418" reg="Woodrow Wilson" link-pointer-type="person">Mr. President</personRef>, keep out of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Mexico</place>.”
            And if one man has said that to me a thousand have said it to me as
            I have moved about the country.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">If I have opportunity to engage them further in
            conversation, they say, “Of course, we know that you can not govern
            the circumstances of the case altogether, and it may be necessary:
            but for God’s sake do not do it unless it is necessary.”</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I am for the time being the spokesman of such people,
            gentlemen. I have not read history without observing that the
            greatest forces in the world and the only permanent forces are the
            moral forces.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">We have the evidence of a very competent witness,
            namely, the first <person refurl="x4000595" reg="Napoleon Bonaparte" link-pointer-type="person">Napoleon</person>, who said that as he
            looked back in the last days of his life upon so much as he knew of
            human history he had to record the judgment that force had never
            accomplished anything that was permanent.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Force will not accomplish anything that is permanent,
            I venture to say, in the <word altform="World War I">great
            struggle</word> which is now going on on the other side of the sea.
            The permanent things will be accomplished afterwards, when the
            opinion of mankind is brought to bear upon the issues, and the only
            thing that will hold the world steady is this same silent,
            insistent, all-powerful opinion of mankind.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Force can sometimes hold things steady until opinion
            has time to form, but no force that was ever exerted, except in
            response to that opinion, was ever a conquering and predominant
            force.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I think the sentence in American history that I myself
            am proudest of is that in the introductory sentences of the
            Declaration of Independence, where the writers say that a due
            respect for the opinion of mankind demands that they state the
            reasons for what they are about to do.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I venture to say that a decent respect for the opinion
            of mankind demanded that those who started the present European war
            should have stated their reasons; but they did not pay any heed to
            the opinion of mankind, and the reckoning will come when the
            settlement comes.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">So, gentlemen, I am willing, no matter what my
            personal fortunes may be, to play for the verdict of mankind.
            Personally, it will be a matter of indifference to me what the
            verdict on the <date value="1916-11-07">7th of November</date> is,
            provided I feel any degree of confidence that when a later jury sits
            I shall get their judgment in my favor. Not in my favor
            personally—what difference does that make?—but in my favor as an
            honest and conscientious spokesman of a great nation.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">There are some gentlemen who are under the delusion
            that the power of a nation comes from the top. It does not. It comes
            from the bottom.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The power and virtue of the tree does not come from
            the blossom and the fruit down into the roots, but it comes from the
            roots in the obscure passages of the earth where the power is
            derived, which displays itself in the blossom and the fruit; and I
            know that among the silent, speechless masses of the American people
            is slowly coming up the great sap of moral purpose and love of
            justice and reverence for humanity which constitutes the only virtue
            and distinction of the American people.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Look for your rulers of the future! Can you pick out
            the families that are going to produce them? Can you pick out the
            localities that are going to produce them?</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">You have heard what has just been said about <person refurl="x4000471" reg="Abraham Lincoln" link-pointer-type="person">Abraham Lincoln</person>. It is
            singular how touching every reference to <person refurl="x4000471" reg="Abraham Lincoln" link-pointer-type="person">Abraham
            Lincoln</person> is. It always makes you feel that you wish you had
            been there to help him in some fashion to fight the battles that he
            was fighting, sometimes almost alone.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Could you have predicted, if you had seen <person refurl="x4000471" reg="Abraham Lincoln" link-pointer-type="person">Abraham Lincoln’s</person> birth and
            boyhood, where that great ruling figure of the world was going to
            spring from?</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I have presided over <placeRef reg="Princeton University" link-pointer-type="place">a university</placeRef>, but I never
            deceived myself by supposing that by university processes you were
            producing the ruling forces of the world.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I knew that all a university could do if it knew its
            business was to interpret the moral forces of the world and let the
            young man, who sat under its influence, know the very truth of
            truths about where it came from, and that no man could produce it
            unless he felt in his blood every corpuscle spring into delighted
            life with the mention of the ideals which have lifted men slowly,
            oh, so slowly, up the arduous grades, that have resisted the
            progress since the world began.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">So, gentlemen, I have not come here to-night to do
            anything but to remind you that you do not constitute the
               <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place>; that I do not constitute the
               <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place>; that it is something bigger and
            greater and finer than any of us; that it was born in an ideal, and
            only by pursuing an ideal in the face of every adverse circumstance
            will it continue to deserve the beloved name which we love and for
            which we are ready to die, the name “<place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place>.”</p>

         <p rend="noindent" xml:space="preserve">Mr. <render as="smallcap" rend="inherit">Chairman, Ladies, and
               Gentlemen</render>:</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">It is with a great deal of gratification that I find
            myself facing so interesting and important a company as this. You
            will readily understand that I have not come here to make an
            elaborate address, but I have come here to express my interest in
            the objects of this great association, and to congratulate you on
            the opportunities which are immediately ahead of you in handling the
            business of this country.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">These are days of incalculable change, my fellow
            citizens. It is impossible for anybody to predict anything that is
            certain, in detail, with regard to the future either of this country
            or of the world in the large movements of business; but one thing is
            perfectly clear, and that is that the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place>
            will play a new part, and that it will be a part of unprecedented
            opportunity and of greatly increased responsibility.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> has had a very
            singular history in respect of its business relationships with the
            rest of the world. I have always believed, and I think you have
            always believed, that there is more business genius in the
               <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> than anywhere else in the world; and
            yet <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> has apparently been afraid of touching
            too intimately the great processes of international exchange.
               <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place>, of all countries in the world, has been
            timid; has not until recently, has not until within the last two or
            three years, provided itself with the fundamental instrumentalities
            for playing a large part in the trade of the world.
            <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place>, which ought to have had the broadest vision
            of any nation, has raised up an extraordinary number of provincial
            thinkers, men who thought provincially about business, men who
            thought that the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> was not ready to take
            her competitive part in the struggle for the peaceful conquest of
            the world. For anybody who reflects philosophically upon the history
            of this country, that is the most amazing fact about it.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">But the time for provincial thinkers has gone by. We
            must play a great part in the world whether we choose it or not. Do
            you know the significance of this single fact, that within the last
            year or two we have, speaking in large terms, ceased to be a debtor
            nation and become a creditor nation? We have more of the surplus
            gold of the world than we ever had before, and our business
            hereafter is to be to lend and to help and to promote the great
            peaceful enterprises of the world. We have got to finance the world
            in some important degree, and those who finance the world must
            understand it and rule it with their spirits and with their minds.
            We can not cabin and confine ourselves any longer, and so I said
            that I came here to congratulate you upon the great rôle that lies
            ahead of you to play. This is a salesmanship congress, and hereafter
            salesmanship will have to be closely related in its outlook and
            scope to statesmanship, to international statesmanship. It will have
            to be touched with an intimate comprehension of the conditions of
            business and enterprise throughout the round globe, because
               <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> will have to place her goods by running
            her intelligence ahead of her goods. No amount of mere push, no
            amount of mere hustling, or, to speak in the western language, no
            amount of mere rustling, no amount of mere active enterprise, will
            suffice.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">There have been two ways of doing business in the
            world outside of the lands in which the great manufactures have been
            made. One has been to try to force the tastes of the manufacturing
            country on the country in which the markets were being sought, and
            the other way has been to study the tastes and needs of the
            countries where the markets were being sought and suit your goods to
            those tastes and needs; and the latter method has beaten the former
            method. If you are going to sell carpets, for example, in
               <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">India</place>, you have got to have as good taste as the
            Indians in the patterns of the carpets, and that is going some. If
            you are going to sell things in tropical countries, they must,
            rather obviously, be different from those which you sell in cold and
            arctic countries. You cannot assume that the rest of the world is
            going to wear or use or manufacture what you wear and use and
            manufacture. Your raw materials must be the raw materials that they
            need, not the raw materials that you need. Your manufactured goods
            must be the manufactured goods which they desire, not those which
            other markets have desired. So your business will keep pace with
            your knowledge, not of yourself and of your manufacturing processes,
            but of them and of their commercial needs. That is statesmanship,
            because that is relating your international activities to the
            conditions which exist in other countries.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">If we can once get what some gentlemen are so loath to
            give us, a merchant marine! The trouble with some men is that they
            are slow in their minds. They do not see; they do not know the need,
            and they will not allow you to point it out to them. If we can once
            get in a position to deliver our own goods, then the goods that we
            have to deliver will be adjusted to the desires of those to whom we
            deliver them, and all the world will welcome America in the great
            field of commerce and manufacture.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">There is a great deal of cant talked, my fellow
            citizens, about service. I wish the word had not been surrounded
            with so much sickly sentimentality, because it is a good, robust,
            red-blooded word, and it is the key to everything that concerns the
            peace and prosperity of the world. You can not force yourself upon
            anybody who is not obliged to take you. The only way in which you
            can be sure of being accepted is by being sure that you have got
            something to offer that is worth taking, and the only way you can be
            sure of that is by being sure that you wish to adapt it to the use
            and the service of the people to whom you are trying to sell.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I was trying to expound in another place the other day
            the long way and the short way to get together. The long way is to
            fight. I hear some gentlemen say that they want to help
               <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Mexico</place>, and the way they propose to help her is to
            overwhelm her with force. That is the long way to help
            <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Mexico</place> as well as the wrong way. After the fighting
            you have a nation full of justified suspicion and animated by
            well-founded hostility and hatred, and then will you help them? Then
            will you establish cordial business relationships with them? Then
            will you go in as neighbors and enjoy their confidence? On the
            contrary, you will have shut every door as if it were of steel
            against you. What makes <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Mexico</place> suspicious of us is
            that she does not believe as yet that we want to serve her. She
            believes that we want to possess her, and she has justification for
            the belief in the way in which some of our fellow-citizens have
            tried to exploit her privileges and possessions. For my part, I will
            not serve the ambitions of these gentlemen, but I will try to serve
            all <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place>, so far as intercourse with
            <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Mexico</place> is concerned, by trying to serve
            <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Mexico</place> herself. There are some things that are not
            debatable. Of course, we have to defend our border. That goes
            without saying. Of course, we must make good our own sovereignty,
            but we must respect the sovereignty of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Mexico</place>. I am
            one of those—I have sometimes suspected that there were not many of
            them—who believe, absolutely believe, the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Virginia</place>
            Bill of Rights, which was the model of the old bill of rights, which
            says that a people has a right to do anything they please with their
            own country and their own government. I am old-fashioned enough to
            believe that, and I am going to stand by that belief. (That is for
            the benefit of those gentlemen who wish to butt in.)</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Now, I use that as an illustration, my fellow
            citizens. What do we all most desire when the present tragical
            confusion of the world’s affairs is over? We desire permanent peace,
            do we not? Permanent peace can grow in only one soil. That is the
            soil of actual good will, and good will can not exist without mutual
            comprehension. <person refurl="x4000426" reg="Charles Lamb" link-pointer-type="person">Charles Lamb</person>, the English
            writer, made a very delightful remark that I have long treasured in
            my memory. He stuttered a little bit, and he said of some one who
            was not present, “I h-h-hate that m-man;” and some one said, “Why,
            Charles, I didn’t know you knew him.” “Oh,” he said, “I-I-I don’t;
            I-I can’t h-hate a m-man I know.” That is a profound human remark.
            You can not hate a man you know. I know some rascals whom I have
            tried to hate. I have tried to head them off as rascals, but I have
            been unable to hate them. I have liked them. And so, not to compare
            like with unlike, in the relationship of nations with each other,
            many of our antagonisms are based upon misunderstandings, and as
            long as you do not understand a country you can not trade with it.
            As long as you can not take its point of view you can not commend
            your goods to its purchase. As long as you go to it with a
            supercilious air, for example, and patronize it, as we have tried to
            do in some less developed countries, and tell them that this is what
            they ought to want whether they want it or not, you can not do
            business with them. You have got to approach them just as you really
            ought to approach all matters of human relationship.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Those people who give their money to philanthropy, for
            example, but can not for the life of them see from the point of view
            of those for whose benefit they are giving the money are not
            philanthropists. They endow and promote philanthropy, but you can
            not be a philanthropist unless you love all sorts and conditions of
            men. The great barrier in this world, I have sometimes thought, is
            not the barrier of principle, but the barrier of taste. Certain
            classes of society find certain other classes of society distasteful
            to them. They do not like the way they dress. They do not like the
            infrequency with which they bathe. They do not like to consort with
            them under the conditions under which they live, and, therefore,
            they stand at a distance from them, and it is impossible for them to
            serve them. They do not understand them and do not feel that common
            pulse of humanity and that common school of experience which is the
            only thing that binds us together and educates us in the same
            fashion.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">This, then, my friends, is the simple message that I
            bring you. Lift your eyes to the horizons of business; do not look
            too close at the little processes with which you are concerned, but
            let your thoughts and your imaginations run abroad throughout the
            whole world, and with the inspiration of the thought that you are
            Americans and are meant to carry liberty and justice and the
            principles of humanity wherever you go, go out and sell goods that
            will make the world more comfortable and more happy, and convert

         <H4>ADDRESS AT LUNCHEON OF SALESMANSHIP CONGRESS, DETROIT,<br/>MICH.,
               <date value="1916-07-10">JULY 10, 1916</date>.</H4>

         <p rend="noindent" xml:space="preserve">Mr. <render as="smallcap" rend="inherit">Chairman, Judge Murphy,
               Ladies and Gentlemen</render>:</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I am glad to find myself in <place reg="Detroit, MI" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Detroit</place> and face to face with the men who have played
            the principal part in giving it distinction throughout the country
            and throughout the world. Looking about among you, I see that it is
            true in this matter, as in others, that the only men fit for such a
            job are young men and men who never grow old. There is the
            liveliness of youth in the eyes even of those of you who have shared
            with me the painful parting with the hirsute appendage.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I have been interested in some things that <person link-pointer-type="person">Mr.
               Denby</person> has said to me <word altform="today">to-day</word>. He has shamefacedly admitted that he has found
            himself enjoying the companionship of Democrats. Now, I have long
            enjoyed the friendship and companionship of Republicans, because I
            am by instinct a teacher and I would like to teach them something.
            We have been trying, some of us, for a good many years to teach in
            politics, as well as elsewhere, this lesson, that we are all in the
            same boat; we have common interests, and it is our business to
            understand and serve those common interests. The great difficulty
            that has confronted us, gentlemen, has often been that we have
            deliberately looked at these common interests from self-chosen
            angles, which made them look as if some of us were separated from
            others; as if some of us wanted to depress business, for example,
            and others of us wanted to exalt business. I dare say that you have
            noticed that the same necessity to make a living is imposed upon
            Democrats as Republicans, and I dare say you are ready to believe
            that Democrats are just as willing to make a good living as
            Republicans. Therefore, it seems to me logically to follow, though I
            have been quoted as having no regard for logic, that Democrats are
            naturally as much interested in the business prosperity of the
               <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> as anybody else. So that if you
            believe that they are not as fitted to guide it as other persons,
            you can not be doubting their interest; you are only impugning their
            intelligence.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">And some Democrats had noticed that the inclination to
            suppose that only some persons understood the business of
               <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> had a tendency to run into the assumption
            that the number of persons who understood that business was very
            small, and that there were only certain groups and associations of
            gentlemen who were entitled to be trustees of that business for the
            rest of us. I have never subscribed, in any walk of life, to the
            trustee theory. I have always been inclined to believe that the
            business of the world was best understood by those men who were in
            the struggle for maintenance not only, but for success. The man who
            knows the strength of the tide is the man who is swimming against
            it, not the man who is floating with it. The man who is immersed in
            the beginnings of business, who is trying to get his foothold, who
            is trying to get other men to believe in him and lend him money and
            trust him to make profitable use of that money, is the man who knows
            what the business conditions in the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place>
            are, and I would rather take his counsel as to what ought to be done
            for business than the counsel of any established captain of
            industry. The captain of industry is looking backward and the other
            man is looking forward. The conditions of business change with every
            generation; change with every decade; are now changing at an almost
            breathless pace, and the men who have made good are not feeling the
            tides as the other men are feeling them. The men who have got into
            the position of captaincy, unless they are of unusual fiber, unless
            they are of unusually catholic sympathy, unless they have continued
            to touch shoulder with the ranks, unless they have continued to keep
            close communion with the men they are employing and the young men
            they are bringing up as their assistants, do not belong to the
            struggle in which we should see that every unreasonable obstacle is
            removed and every reasonable help afforded that public policy can
            afford.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">So I invite your thoughts, in what I sincerely believe
            to be an en-entirely nonpartisan spirit, to the democracy of
            business. An act was recently passed in Congress that some of the
            most intelligent business men of this country earnestly opposed,—men
            whom I knew, men whose character I trusted, men whose integrity I
            absolutely believed in. I refer to the Federal Reserve Act, by which
            we intended to take, and succeeded in taking credit out of the
            control of a small number of men and making it available to
            everybody who had real commercial assets, and the very men who
            opposed that act, and opposed it conscientiously, now admit that it
            saved the country from a ruinous panic when the stress of <word altform="World War I">war</word> came on, and that it is the
            salvation of every average business man who is in the midst of the
            tides that I have been trying to describe. What does that mean,
            gentlemen? It means that you can get a settled point of view and can
            conscientiously oppose progress if you do not need progress
            yourself. That is what it means. I am not impugning the intelligence
            even of the men who opposed these things, because the same thing
            happens to every man if he is not of extraordinary make-up, if he
            can not see the necessity for a thing that he does not himself need.
            When you have abundant credit and control of credit, you, of course,
            do not need that the area of credit should be broadened.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The suspicion is beginning to dawn in many quarters
            that the average man knows the business necessities of the country
            just as well as the extraordinary man does. I believe in the
            ordinary man. If I did not believe in the ordinary man I would move
            out of a democracy and, if I found an endurable monarchy, I would
            live in it. The very conception of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> is based
            upon the validity of the judgments of the average man, and I call
            you to witness that there have not been many catastrophes in
            American history. I call you to witness that the average judgments
            of the voters of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> have been sound
            judgments. I call you to witness that this great impulse of the
            common opinion has been a lifting impulse, and not a depressing
            impulse. What is the object of associations like that which is
            gathered here to-day, this Salesmanship Congress? The moral of it is
            that a few men can not determine the interests of a large body of
            men, and that the only way to determine them and advance them is to
            have a representative assembly chosen by themselves get together and
            take common counsel regarding them. And do you not notice that in
            every great occupation in the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> there is
            beginning to be more and more of this common counsel? And have you
            not noticed that the more common counsel you have the higher the
            standards are that are insisted upon?</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I attended the other day the Congress of the
            Advertising Men, and their motto is “Truth and fair dealing in what
            you represent your business to be and your goods to be.” I have no
            doubt that in every association like this the prevailing sentiment
            is that only by the highest standards—I mean the highest moral
            standards—can you achieve the most permanent and satisfactory
            business results. Was that the prevalent conception before these
            associations were drawn together? Have you not found the moral
            judgment of the average man steady the whole process and clarify it?
            Do you not know more after every conference with your fellows than
            you did before? I never went into a committee of any kind upon any
            important public matter, or private matter so far as that is
            concerned, that I did not come out with an altered judgment and
            knowing much more about the matter than when I went in; and not only
            knowing much more, but knowing that the common judgment arrived at
            was better than I could have suggested when I went in. That is the
            universal experience of candid men. If it were not so, there would
            be no object in congresses like this. Yet whenever we attempt
            legislation, we find ourselves in this case: We are not in the
            presence of the many who can counsel wisely, but we are in the
            presence of the few who counsel too narrowly, and the means by which
            we have been trying to break away from that is not by excluding
            these gentlemen who constituted the narrow circles of advice, but by
            associating them with hundreds of thousands of their fellow
            citizens.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I have had some say that I was not accessible to them,
            and when I inquired into it I found they meant that I did not
            personally invite them. They did not know how to come without being
            invited, and they did not care to come if they came upon the same
            terms with everybody else, knowing that everybody else was welcome
            whom I had the time to confer with.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Am I telling you things unobserved by you? Do you not
            know that these things are true? And do you not believe with me that
            the affairs of the Nation can be better conducted upon the basis of
            general counsel than upon the basis of special counsel? Men are
            colored and governed by their occupations and their surroundings and
            their habits. If I wanted to change the law radically, I would not
            consult a lawyer. If I wanted to change business methods radically,
            I would not consult a man who had made a conspicuous success by
            using the present methods that I wanted to change. Not because I
            would distrust these men, but because I would know that they would
            not change their thinking over night, that they would have to go
            through a long process of reacquaintance with the circumstances of
            the time, the new circumstances of the time, before they could be
            converted to my point of view. You get a good deal more light on the
            street than you do in the closet. You get a good deal more light by
            keeping your ears open among the rank and file of your fellow
            citizens than you do in any private conference whatever. I would
            rather hear what the men are talking about on the trains and in the
            shops and by the fireside than hear anything else, because I want
            guidance and I know I could get it there, and what I am constantly
            asking is that men should bring me that counsel, because I am not
            privileged to determine things independently of this counsel. I am
            your servant, not your ruler.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">One thing that we are now trying to convert the small
            circles to that the big circles are already converted to is that
            this country needs a merchant marine and ought to get one. I have
            found that I had a great deal more resistance when I tried to help
            business than when I tried to interfere with it. I have had a great
            deal more resistance of counsel, of special counsel, when I tried to
            alter the things that are established than when I tried to do
            anything else. We call ourselves a liberal nation, whereas, as a
            matter of fact, we are one of the most conservative nations in the
            world. If you want to make enemies, try to change something. You
            know why it is. To do things <word altform="today">to-day</word>
            exactly the way you did them yesterday saves thinking. It does not
            cost you anything. You have acquired the habit; you know the
            routine; you do not have to plan anything, and it frightens you with
            a hint of exertion to learn that you will have to do it a different
            way <word altform="tomorrow">to-morrow</word>. Until I became a
            college teacher, I used to think that the young men were radical,
            but college boys are the greatest conservatives I ever tackled in my
            life, largely because they have associated too much with their
            fathers. What you have to do with them is to take them up upon some
            visionary height and show them the map of the world as it is. Do not
            let them see their father’s factory. Do not let them see their
            father’s countinghouse. Let them see the great valleys teeming with
            laborious people. Let them see the great struggle of men in realms
            they never dreamed of. Let them see the great emotional power that
            is in the world, the great ambitions, the great hopes, the great
            fears. Give them some picture of mankind, and then their father’s
            business and every other man’s business will begin to fall into
            place. They will see that it is an item and not the whole thing; and
            they will sometimes see that the item is not properly related to the
            whole, and what they will get interested in will be to relate the
            item to the whole, so that it will form part of the force, and not
            part of the impediment.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">This country, above every country in the world,
            gentlemen, is meant to lift; it is meant to add to the forces that
            improve. It is meant to add to everything that betters the world,
            that gives it better thinking, more honest endeavor, a closer
            grapple of man with man, so that we will all be pulling together
            like one irresistible team in a single harness. That is the reason
            why it seemed wise to substitute for the harsh processes of the law,
            which merely lays its hand on your shoulder after you have sinned
            and threatens you with punishment, some of the milder and more
            helpful processes of counsel. That is the reason the Federal Trade
            Commission was established,—so that men would have some place where
            they could take counsel as to what the law was and what the law
            permitted; and also take counsel as to whether the law itself was
            right and advice had not better be taken as to its alteration. The
            proceseses of counsel are the only processes of accommodation, not
            the processes of punishment. Punishment retards but it does not lift
            up. Punishment impedes but it does not improve. And we ought to
            substitute for the harsh processes of the law, wherever we can, the
            milder and gentler and more helpful processes of counsel.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">It has been a very great grief to some of us, year
            after year, year after year, to see a fundamental thing like the
            fiscal policy of the Government with regard to duties on imports
            made a football of politics. Why, gentlemen, party politics ought to
            have nothing to do with the question of what is for the benefit of
            the business of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place>, and that is the
            reason we ought to have a tariff commission, and, I may add, are
            going to have a tariff commission. But, then, gentlemen, the trouble
            will be upon me. The provision as it stands makes it obligatory upon
            me not to choose more than half the commission from any one
            political party. The bill does not undertake to say how many
            political parties there are. That just now is a delicate question.
            But I am forbidden to take more than two of the same variety, and
            yet the trouble about that is I would like to find men for that
            commission who were of no one of the varieties. I would like to find
            men who would find out the circumstances of American business,
            particularly as it changes and is going to change with perplexing
            rapidity in the years immediately ahead of us, without any regard
            whatever to the interest of any party whatever, so that we should be
            able to legislate upon the facts and upon the large economic aspects
            of those facts without stopping to think which party it was going to
            hurt and which party it was going to benefit. But almost everybody
            in this country wears a label of some kind, and under the law I
            suppose I will have to turn them around and see how they are
            labeled, how they are branded; and that is going to be a very great
            blow to my spirit and a very great test of my judgment. I hope,
            after the results are achieved, you will judge me leniently, because
            my desire would be not to have a bipartisan but an absolutely
            nonpartisan commission of men who really applied the tests of
            scientific analysis of the facts and no other tests whatever to the
            conclusions that they arrived at.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Did you ever think how absolutely supreme and
            sovereign facts are? You can make laws all the year through contrary
            to the facts and the facts will overrun the laws. Do not let a fact
            catch you napping, because you will get the worst of it if you do;
            and the object of the tariff commission is that we should see the
            facts coming first, so that they could not get us. I remember a
            cynical politician saying to me once, when I was thanking him for
            having voted the way I hoped he would vote, knowing that that had
            not been his initial inclination, “Well, Governor, they never get me
            if I see them coming first.” He had heard from home, and he saw them
            coming. Now, I have that attitude toward facts. I never let them get
            me if I see them first, and it is because I want to see them that I
            want commissions of this sort and the spirit of this sort that I
            have tried to describe in the commission as it is constituted.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Because, as I was saying this morning, there is a task
            ahead of us of most collossal difficulty. We have not been
            accustomed to the large world of international business and we have
            got to get accustomed to it right away. All provincials have got to
            take a back seat. All men who are afraid of competition have got to
            take a back seat. All men who depend upon anything except their
            intelligence and their efficiency have got to take a back seat. It
            will be interesting to see the sifting process go on. I have some
            men in mind to nominate for back seats, and I will not draw all of
            them from the same party. It will not need an act of Congress for
            that purpose. And some men are going to be surprised at the keenness
            of the air into which they are thrust out. They are going to be
            thrust out, and we are either going to make conquest, peaceful
            conquest, of the markets of the world or we are going to be
            prevented forevermore of boasting of the business ability of
               <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place>. I have never been afraid of trusting an
            American business man out in the air, but some men have. They have
            said, “Give us a wall to crouch behind for fear these fellows should
            get us,” and when it has come to finding out who were crouching
            behind the wall, it was found that all sorts were crouching behind
            the wall, the capable and the incapable, and that the main object of
            the wall was to shelter the incapable.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">As an American I am too proud to submit to anything
            like that. I believe that Americans can manufacture goods better
            than anybody else; that they can sell goods as honestly as anybody
            else; that they can find out the conditions and meet the conditions
            of foreign business better than anybody else, and I want to see them
            given a chance right away, and they will be whether I want them to
            be or not. We have been trying to get ready for it. The national
            banks of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place>, until the recent Currency
            Act, were held back by the very terms of the law under which they
            operated from some of the most important international transactions.
            To my mind that is one of the most amazing facts of our commercial
            history. The Congress of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> was not
            willing that the national banks should have a latchkey and go away
            from home. They were afraid they would not know how to get back
            under cover, and banks from other countries had to establish
            branches where American bankers were doing business, to take care of
            some of the most important processes of international exchange. That
            is nothing less than amazing, but it is not necessary any longer. It
            never was necessary; it was only thought to be necessary by some
            eminently provincial statesmen. We are done with provincialism in
            the statesmanship of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place>, and we have
            got to have a view now and a horizon as wide as the world itself.
            And when I look around upon an alert company like this, it seems to
            me in my imagination they are almost straining at the leash. They
            are waiting to be let loose upon this great race that is now going
            to challenge our abilities. For my part, I shall look forward to the
            result with absolute and serene confidence, because the spirit of
            the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> is an international spirit, if we
            conceive it right. This is not the home of any particular race of
            men. This is not the home of any particular set of political
            traditions. This is a home the doors of which have been opened from
            the first to mankind, to everybody who loved liberty, to everybody
            whose ideal was equality of opportunity, to everybody whose heart
            was moved by the fundamental instincts and sympathies of humanity.
            That is <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place>, and now it is as if the nations of
            the world, sampled and united here, were in their new union and new
            common understanding turning about to serve the world with all the
            honest processes of business and of enterprise. I am happy that I
            should be witnessing the dawn of the day when <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place>
            is indeed to come into her own.</p>

         <p rend="noindent" xml:space="preserve"><render as="smallcap" rend="inherit">My Fellow Cittzens</render>:</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">This is an entire surprise party to me. I did not know
            I was going to have the pleasure of stopping long enough to address
            any number of you, but I am very glad indeed to give you my very
            cordial greetings and to express my very great interest in this
            interesting city.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve"><person link-pointer-type="person">General Sherwood</person> said that there were
            many things we agreed about, there is one thing we disagree about.
               <person link-pointer-type="person">General Sherwood</person> has been opposing preparedness,
            and I have been advocating it, and I am very sorry to have found him
            on the other side. Because, I think, you will bear me witness,
            fellow citizens, that in advocating preparedness I have not been
            advocating hostility. You will bear me witness that I have been a
            persistent friend of peace and that nothing but unmistakable
            necessity will drive me from that position. I think it is a matter
            of sincere congratulation to us that our neighbor <placeRef reg="Mexico" link-pointer-type="place">Republic to the south</placeRef> shows evidences of
            at last believing in our friendly intentions; that while we must
            protect our border and see to it that our sovereignty is not
            impugned, we are ready to respect their sovereignty also, and to be
            their friends, and not their enemies.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The real uses of intelligence, my fellow citizens, are
            the uses of peace. Any body of men can get up a row, but only an
            intelligent body of men can get together and cooperate. Peace is not
            only a test of a nation’s patience; it is also a test of whether the
            nation knows how to conduct its relations or not. It takes time to
            do intelligent things, and it does not take any time to do
            unintelligent things. I can lose my temper in a minute, but it takes
            me a long time to keep it, and I think that if you were to subject
            my Scotch-Irish blood to the proper kind of analysis, you would find
            that it was fighting blood, and that it is pretty hard for a man
            born that way to keep quiet and do things in the way in which his
            intelligence tells him he ought to do them. I know just as well as
            that I am standing here that I represent and am the servant of a
            Nation that loves peace, and that loves it upon the proper basis;
            loves it not because it is afraid of anybody; loves it not because
            it does not understand and mean to maintain its rights, but because
            it knows that humanity is something in which we are all linked
            together, and that it behooves the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place>,
            just as long as it is possible, to hold off from becoming involved
            in a strife which makes it all the more necessary that some part of
            the world should keep cool while all the rest of it is hot. Here in
               <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place>, for the time being, are the spaces, the
            cool spaces, of thoughtfulness, and so long as we are allowed to do
            so, we will serve and not contend with the rest of our fellow men.
            We are the more inclined to do this because the very principles upon
            which our Government is based are principles of common counsel and
            not of contest.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">So, my fellow citizens, I congratulate myself upon
            this opportunity, brief as it is, to give you my greetings and to
            convey to you my congratulations that the signs that surround us are
            all signs of peace.</p>

         <p rend="noindent" xml:space="preserve">Mr. <render as="smallcap" rend="inherit">Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen</render>:</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I have come here for the simple purpose of expressing my very deep interest in what these conferences are intended to attain. It is not fair to the great multitudes of hopeful men and women who press into this country from other countries that we should leave them without that friendly and intimate instruction which will enable them very soon after they come to find out what <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> is like at heart and what <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> is intended for among the nations of the world.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I believe that the chief school that these people must attend after they get here is the school which all of us attend, which is furnished by the life of the communities in which we live and the nation to which we belong. It has been a very touching thought to me sometimes to think of the hopes which have drawn these people to <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place>. I have no doubt that many a simple soul has been thrilled by that <word altform="Statue of Liberty">great statue</word> standing in the harbor of <place reg="New York, NY" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">New York</place> and seeming to lift the light of liberty for the guidance of the feet of men; and I can imagine that they have expected here something ideal in the treatment that they will receive, something ideal in the laws which they would have to live under, and it has caused me many a time to turn upon myself the eye of examination to see whether there burned in me the true light of the American spirit which they expected to find here. It is easy, my fellow-citizens, to communicate physical lessons, but it is very difficult to communicate spiritual lessons. <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> was intended to be a spirit among the nations of the world, and it is the purpose of conferences like this to find out the best way to introduce the newcomers to this spirit, and by that very interest in them to enhance and purify in ourselves the thing that ought to make <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> great and not only ought to make her great, but ought to make her exhibit a spirit unlike any other nation in the world.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I have never been among those who felt comfortable in boasting of the superiority of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> over other countries. The way to cure yourself of that is to travel in other countries and find out how much of nobility and character and fine enterprise there is everywhere in the world. The most that <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> can hope to do is to show, it may be, the finest example, not the only example, of the things that ought to benefit and promote the progress of the world.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">So my interest in this movement is as much an interest in ourselves as in those whom we are trying to Americanize, because if we are genuine Americans they cannot avoid the infection; whereas, if we are not genuine Americans, there will be nothing to infect them with, and no amount of teaching, no amount of exposition of the Constitution,—which I find very few persons understand,—no amount of dwelling upon the idea of liberty and of justice will accomplish the object we have in view, unless we ourselves illustrate the idea of justice and of liberty. My interest in this movement is, therefore, a two-fold interest. I believe it will assist us to become self-conscious in respect of the fundamental ideas of American life. When you ask a man to be loyal to a government, if he comes from some foreign countries, his idea is that he is expected to be loyal to a certain set of persons like a ruler or a body set in authority over him, but that is not the American idea. Our idea is that he is to be loyal to certain objects in life, and that the only reason he has a President and a Congress and a Governor and a State Legislature and courts is that the community shall have intrumentalities by which to promote those objects. It is a cooperative organization expressing itself in this Constitution, expressing itself in these laws, intending to express itself in the exposition of those laws by the courts; and the idea of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> is not so much that men are to be restrained and punished by the law as instructed and guided by the law. That is the reason so many hopeful reforms come to grief. A law cannot work until it expresses the spirit of the community for which it is enacted, and if you try to enact into law what expresses only the spirit of a small coterie or of a small minority, you know, or at any rate you ought to know, beforehand that it is not going to work. The object of the law is that there, written upon these pages, the citizen should read the record of the experience of this state and nation; what they have concluded it is necessary for them to do because of the life they have lived and the things that they have discovered to be elements in that life. So that we ought to be careful to maintain a government at which the immigrant can look with the closest scrutiny and to which he should be at liberty to address this question: “You declare this to be a land of liberty and of equality and of justice; have you made it so by your law?” We ought to be able in our schools, in our night schools and in every other method of instructing these people, to show them that that has been our endeavor. We cannot conceal from them long the fact that we are just as human as any other nation, that we are just as selfish, that there are just as many mean people amongst us as anywhere else, that there are just as many people here who want to take advantage of other people as you can find in other countries, just as many cruel people, just as many people heartless when it comes to maintaining and promoting their own interest; but you can show that our object is to get these people in harness and see to it that they do not do any damage and are not allowed to indulge the passions which would bring injustice and calamity at last upon a nation whose object is spiritual and not material.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve"><place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> has built up a great body of wealth. <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> has become, from the physical point of view, one of the most powerful nations in the world, a nation which if it took the pains to do so, could build that power up into one of the most formidable instruments in the world, one of the most formidable instruments of force, but which has no other idea than to use its force for ideal objects and not for self-aggrandizement.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">We have been disturbed recently, my fellow-citizens, by certain symptoms which have showed themselves in our body politic. Certain men,—I have never believed a great number,—born in other lands, have in recent months thought more of those lands than they have of the honor and interest of the government under which they are now living. They have even gone so far as to draw apart in spirit and in organization from the rest of us to accomplish some special object of their own. I am not here going to utter any criticism of these people, but I want to say this, that such a thing as that is absolutely incompatible with the fundamental idea of loyalty, and that loyalty is not a self-pleasing virtue. I am not bound to be loyal to the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> to please myself. I am bound to be loyal to the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> because I live under its laws and am its citizen, and whether it hurts me or whether it benefits me, I am obliged to be loyal. Loyalty means nothing unless it has at its heart the absolute principle of self-sacrifice. Loyalty means that you ought to be ready to sacrifice every interest that you have, and your life itself, if your country calls upon you to do so, and that is the sort of loyalty which ought to be inculcated into these newcomers, that they are not to be loyal only so long as they are pleased, but that, having once entered into this sacred relationship, they are bound to be loyal whether they are pleased or not; and that loyalty which is merely self-pleasing is only self-indulgence and selfishness. No man has ever risen to the real stature of spiritual manhood until he has found that it is finer to serve somebody else than it is to serve himself.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">These are the conceptions which we ought to teach the newcomers into our midst, and we ought to realize that the life of every one of us is part of the schooling, and that we cannot preach loyalty unless we set the example, that we cannot profess things with any influence upon others unless we practice them also. This process of Americanization is going to be a process of self-examination, a process of purification, a process of rededication to the things which <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> represents and is proud to represent. And it takes a great deal more courage and steadfastness, my fellow-citizens, to represent ideal things than to represent anything else. It is easy to lose your temper, and hard to keep it. It is easy to strike and sometimes very difficult to refrain from striking, and I think you will agree with me that we are most justified in being proud of doing the things that are hard to do and not the things that are easy. You do not settle things quickly by taking what seems to be the quickest way to settle them. You may make the complication just that much the more profound and inextricable, and, therefore, what I believe <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> should exalt above everything else is the sovereignty of thoughtfulness and sympathy and vision as against the grosser impulses of mankind. No nation can live without vision, and no vision will exalt a nation except the vision of real liberty and real justice and purity of conduct.</p>

         <p rend="noindent" xml:space="preserve"><render as="smallcap" rend="inherit">Gentlemen of the Congress</render>:</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I have come to you to seek your assistance in dealing with a very grave situation which has
                arisen out of the demand of the employees of the railroads engaged in freight train service that they be
                granted an eight-hour working day, safeguarded by payment for an hour and a half of service for every
                hour of work beyond the eight.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The matter has been agitated for more than a year. The public has been made familiar with
                the demands of the men and the arguments urged in favor of them, and even more familiar with the
                objections of the railroads and their counter demand that certain privileges now enjoyed by their men
                and certain bases of payment worked out through many years of contest be reconsidered, especially in
                their relation to the adoption of an eight-hour day. The matter came some three weeks ago to a final
                issue and resulted in a complete deadlock between the parties. The means provided by law for the
                mediation of the controversy failed and the means of arbitration for which the law provides were
                rejected. The representatives of the railway executives proposed that the demands of the men be
                submitted in their entirety to arbitration, along with certain questions of readjustment as to pay and
                conditions of employment which seemed to them to be either closely associated with the demands or to
                call for reconsideration on their own merits; the men absolutely declined arbitration, especially if any
                of their established privileges were by that means to be drawn again in question. The law in the matter
                put no compulsion upon them. The four hundred thousand men from whom the demands proceeded had voted to
                strike if their demands were refused; the strike was imminent; it has since been set for the <date value="1916-09-04">fourth of September next</date>. It affects the men who man the freight trains on
                practically every railway in the country. The freight service throughout the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United
                States</place> must stand still until their places are filled, if, indeed, it should prove possible to
                fill them at all. Cities will be cut off from their food supplies, the whole commerce of the nation will
                be paralyzed, men of every sort and occupation will be thrown out of employment, countless thousands
                will in all likelihood be brought, it may be, to the very point of starvation, and a tragical national
                calamity brought on, to be added to the other distresses of the time, because no basis of accommodation
                or settlement has been found.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Just so soon as it became evident that mediation under the existing law had failed and that
                arbitration had been rendered impossible by the attitude of the men, I considered it my duty to confer
                with the representatives of both the railways and the brotherhoods, and myself offer mediation, not as
                an arbitrator, but merely as spokesman of the nation, in the interest of justice, indeed, and as a
                friend of both parties, but not as judge, only as the representative of one hundred millions of men,
                women, and children who would pay the price, the incalculable price, of loss and suffering should these
                few men insist upon approaching and concluding the matters in controversy between them merely as
                employers and employees, rather than as patriotic citizens of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> looking
                before and after and accepting the larger responsibility which the public would put upon them.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">It seemed to me, in considering the subject-matter of the controversy, that the whole
                spirit of the time and the preponderant evidence of recent economic experience spoke for the eight-hour
                day. It has been adjudged by the thought and experience of recent years a thing upon which society is
                justified in insisting as in the interest of health, efficiency, contentment, and a general increase of
                economic vigor. The whole presumption of modern experience would, it seemed to me, be in its favor,
                whether there was arbitration or not, and the debatable points to settle were those which arose out of
                the acceptance of the eight-hour day rather than those which affected its establishment. I, therefore,
                proposed that the eight-hour day be adopted by the railway managements and put into practice for the
                present as a substitute for the existing ten-hour basis of pay and service; that I should appoint, with
                the permission of the Congress, a small commission to observe the results of the change, carefully
                studying the figures of the altered operating costs, not only, but also the conditions of labor under
                which the men worked and the operation of their existing agreements with the railroads, with
                instructions to report the facts as they found them to the Congress at the earliest possible day, but
                without recommendation; and that, after the facts had been thus disclosed, an adjustment should in some
                orderly manner be sought of all the matters now left unadjusted between the railroad managers and the
                men.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">These proposals were exactly in line, it is interesting to note, with the position taken by
                the Supreme Court of the United States when appealed to to protect certain litigants from the financial
                losses which they confidently expected if they should submit to the regulation of their charges and of
                their methods of service by public legislation. The Court has held that it would not undertake to form a
                judgment upon forecasts, but could base its action only upon actual experience; that it must be supplied
                with facts, not with calculations and opinions, however scientifically attempted. To undertake to
                arbitrate the question of the adoption of an eight-hour day in the light of results merely estimated and
                predicted would be to undertake an enterprise of conjecture. No wise man could undertake it, or, if he
                did undertake it, could feel assured of his conclusions.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I unhesitatingly offered the friendly services of the administration to the railway
                managers to see to it that justice was done the railroads in the outcome. I felt warranted in assuring
                them that no obstacle of law would be suffered to stand in the way of their increasing their revenues to
                meet the expenses resulting from the change so far as the development of their business and of their
                administrative efficiency did not prove adequate to meet them. The public and the representatives of the
                public, I felt justified in assuring them, were disposed to nothing but justice in such cases and were
                willing to serve those who served them.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The representatives of the brotherhoods accepted the plan; but the representatives of the
                railroads declined to accept it. In the face of what I cannot but regard as the practical certainty that
                they will be ultimately obliged to accept the eight-hour day by the concerted action of organized labor,
                backed by the favorable judgment of society, the representatives of the railway management have felt
                justified in declining a peaceful settlement which would engage all the forces of justice, public and
                private, on their side to take care of the event. They fear the hostile influence of shippers, who would
                be opposed to an increase of freight rates (for which, however, of course, the public itself would pay);
                they apparently feel no confidence that the Interstate Commerce Commission could withstand the
                objections that would be made. They do not care to rely upon the friendly assurances of the Congress or
                    <personRef refurl="x4000418" reg="Woodrow Wilson" link-pointer-type="person">the
                President</personRef>. They have thought it best that they should be forced to yield, if they must
                yield, not by counsel, but by the suffering of the country. While my conferences with them were in
                progress, and when to all outward appearance those conferences had come to a standstill, the
                representatives of the brotherhoods suddenly acted and set the strike for the <date value="1916-09-04">fourth of September</date>.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The railway managers based their decision to reject my counsel in this matter upon their
                conviction that they must at any cost to themselves or to the country stand firm for the principle of
                arbitration which the men had rejected. I based my counsel upon the indisputable fact that there was no
                means of obtaining arbitration. The law supplied none; earnest efforts at mediation had failed to
                influence the men in the least. To stand firm for the principle of arbitration and yet not get
                arbitration seemed to me futile, and something more than futile, because it involved incalculable
                distress to the country and consequences in some respects worse than those of war, and that in the midst
                of peace.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I yield to no man in firm adherence, alike of conviction and of purpose, to the principle
                of arbitration in industrial disputes; but matters have come to a sudden crisis in this particular
                dispute and the country had been caught unprovided with any practicable means of enforcing that
                conviction in practice (by whose fault we will not now stop to inquire). A situation had to be met whose
                elements and fixed conditions were indisputable. The practical and patriotic course to pursue, as it
                seemed to me, was to secure immediate peace by conceding the one thing in the demands of the men which
                society itself and any arbitrators who represented public sentiment were most likely to approve, and
                immediately lay the foundations for securing arbitration with regard to everything else involved. The
                event has confirmed that judgment.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I was seeking to compose the present in order to safeguard the future; for I wished an
                atmosphere of peace and friendly cooperation in which to take counsel with the representatives of the
                nation with regard to the best means for providing, so far as it might prove possible to provide,
                against the recurrence of such unhappy situations in the future,—the best and most practicable means of
                securing calm and fair arbitration of all industrial disputes in the days to come. This is assuredly the
                best way of vindicating a principle, namely, having failed to make certain of its observance in the
                present, to make certain of its observance in the future.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">But I could only propose. I could not govern the will of others who took an entirely
                different view of the circumstances of the case, who even refused to admit the circumstances to be what
                they have turned out to be.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Having failed to bring the parties to this critical controversy to an accommodation,
                therefore, I turn to you, deeming it clearly our duty as public servants to leave nothing undone that we
                can do to safeguard the life and interests of the nation. In the spirit of such a purpose, I earnestly
                recommend the following legislation:</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">First, immediate provision for the enlargement and administrative reorganization of the
                Interstate Commerce Commission along the lines embodied in the bill recently passed by the House of
                Representatives and now awaiting action by the Senate; in order that the Commission may be enabled to
                deal with the many great and various duties now devolving upon it with a promptness and thoroughness
                which are with its present constitution and means of action practically impossible.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Second, the establishment of an eight-hour day as the legal basis alike of work and of
                wages in the employment of all railway employees who are actually engaged in the work of operating
                trains in interstate transportation.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Third, the authorization of the appointment by <personRef refurl="x4000418" reg="Woodrow Wilson" link-pointer-type="person">the President</personRef> of a small body of men to
                observe the actual results in experience of the adoption of the eight-hour day in railway transportation
                alike for the men and for the railroads; its effects in the matter of operating costs, in the
                application of the existing practices and agreements to the new conditions, and in all other practical
                aspects, with the provision that the investigators shall report their conclusions to the Congress at the
                earliest possible date, but without recommendation as to legislative action; in order that the public
                may learn from an unprejudiced source just what actual developments have ensued.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Fourth, explicit approval by the Congress of the consideration by the Interstate Commerce
                Commission of an increase of freight rates to meet such additional expenditures by the railroads as may
                have been rendered necessary by the adoption of the eight-hour day and which have not been offset by
                administrative readjustments and economies, should the facts disclosed justify the increase.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Fifth, an amendment of the existing federal statute which provides for the mediation,
                conciliation, and arbitration of such controversies as the present by adding to it a provision that in
                case the methods of accommodation now provided for should fail, a full public investigation of the
                merits of every such dispute shall be instituted and completed before a strike or lockout may lawfully
                be attempted.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">And, sixth, the lodgement in the hands of the Executive of the power, in case of military
                necessity, to take control of such portions and such rolling stock of the railways of the country as may
                be required for military use and to operate them for military purposes, with authority to draft into the
                military service of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> such train crews and administrative officials as
                the circumstances require for their safe and efficient use.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">This last suggestion I make because we cannot in any circumstances suffer the nation to be
                hampered in the essential matter of national defense. At the present moment circumstances render this
                duty particularly obvious. Almost the entire military force of the nation is stationed upon the Mexican
                border to guard our territory against hostile raids. It must be supplied, and steadily supplied, with
                whatever it needs for its maintenance and efficiency. If it should be necessary for purposes of national
                defense to transfer any portion of it upon short notice to some other part of the country, for reasons
                now unforeseen, ample means of transportation must be available, and available without delay. The power
                conferred in this matter should be carefully and explicitly limited to cases of military necessity, but
                in all such cases it should be clear and ample.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">There is one other thing we should do if we are true champions of arbitration. We should
                make all arbitral awards judgements by record of a court of law in order that their interpretation and
                enforcement may lie, not with one of the parties to the arbitration, but with an impartial and
                authoritative tribunal.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">These things I urge upon you, not in haste or merely as a means of meeting a present
                emergency, but as permanent and necessary additions to the law of the land, suggested, indeed, by
                circumstances we had hoped never to see, but imperative as well as just, if such emergencies are to be
                prevented in the future. I feel that no extended argument is needed to commend them to your favorable
                consideration. They demonstrate themselves. The time and the occasion only give emphasis to their
                importance. We need them now and we shall continue to need them.</p>

         <H3>ACCEPTING THE NOMINATION FOR<br/>PRESIDENT BY THE DEMOCRATIC<br/>PARTY</H3>
         <p rend="center" xml:space="preserve"><space dim="vertical" extent="1" units="em"/>_________<space dim="vertical" extent="1" units="em"/>DELIVERED AT <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">SHADOW LAWN, N. J.</place><br/>SATURDAY, <date value="1916-09-02">SEPTEMBER 2, 1916</date><space dim="vertical" extent="1" units="em"/>_________<space dim="vertical" extent="1" units="em"/></p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve"><render as="smallcap" rend="inherit">Senator James, Gentlemen of the Notification Committee, Fellow citizens</render>: I cannot accept the leadership and responsibility which the National Democratic Convention has again, in such generous fashion, asked me to accept without first expressing my profound gratitude to the party for the trust it reposes in me after four years of fiery trial in the midst of affairs of unprecedented difficulty, and the keen sense of added responsibility with which this <word altform="honor">honour</word> fills (I had almost said burdens) me as I think of the great issues of national life and policy involved in the present and immediate future conduct of our government. I shall seek, as I have always sought, to justify the extraordinary confidence thus reposed in me by striving to purge my heart and purpose of every personal and of every misleading party motive and devoting every energy I have to the service of the nation as a whole, praying that I may continue to have the counsel and support of all forward-looking men at every turn of the difficult business.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">For I do not doubt that the people of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> will wish the Democratic Party to continue in control of the Government. They are not in the habit of rejecting those who have actually served them for those who are making doubtful and conjectural promises of service. Least of all are they likely to substitute those who promised to render them particular services and proved false to that promise for those who have actually rendered those very services.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Boasting is always an empty business, which pleases nobody but the boaster, and I have no disposition to boast of what the Democratic Party has accomplished. It has merely done its duty. It has merely fulfilled its explicit promises. But there can be no violation of good taste in calling attention to the manner in which those promises have been carried out or in adverting to the interesting fact that many of the things accomplished were what the opposition party had again and again promised to do but had left undone. Indeed that is manifestly part of the business of this year of reckoning and assessment. There is no means of judging the future except by assessing the past. Constructive action must be weighed against destructive comment and reaction. The Democrats either have or have not understood the varied interests of the country. The test is contained in the record.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">What is that record? What were the Democrats called into power to do? What things had long waited to be done, and how did the Democrats do them? It is a record of extraordinary length and variety, rich in elements of many kinds, but consistent in principle throughout and susceptible of brief recital.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The Republican party was put out of power because of failure, practical failure and moral failure; because it had served special interests and not the country at large; because, under the leadership of its preferred and established guides, of those who still make its choices, it had lost touch with the thoughts and the needs of the nation and was living in a past age and under a fixed illusion, the illusion of greatness. It had framed tariff laws based upon a fear of foreign trade, a fundamental doubt as to American skill, enterprise, and capacity, and a very tender regard for the profitable privileges of those who had gained control of domestic markets and domestic credits; and yet had enacted anti-trust laws which hampered the very things they meant to foster, which were stiff and inelastic, and in part unintelligible. It had permitted the country throughout the long period of its control to stagger from one financial crisis to another under the operation of a national banking law of its own framing which made stringency and panic certain and the control of the larger business operations of the country by the bankers of a few reserve <word altform="centers">centres</word> inevitable; had made as if it meant to reform the law but had faint-heartedly failed in the attempt, because it could not bring itself to do the one thing necessary to make the reform genuine and effectual, namely, break up the control of small groups of bankers. It had been oblivious, or indifferent, to the fact that the farmers, upon whom the country depends for its food and in the last analysis for its prosperity, were without standing in the matter of commercial credit, without the protection of standards in their market transactions, and without systematic knowledge of the markets themselves; that the <word altform="laborers">labourers</word> of the country, the great army of men who man the industries it was professing to father and promote, carried their <word altform="labor">labour</word> as a mere commodity to market, were subject to restraint by novel and drastic process in the courts, were without assurance of compensation for industrial accidents, without federal assistance in accommodating <word altform="labor">labour</word> disputes, and without national aid or advice in finding the places and the industries in which their <word altform="labor">labour</word> was most needed. The country had no national system of road construction and development. Little intelligent attention was paid to the army, and not enough to the navy. The other republics of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> distrusted us, because they found that we thought first of the profits of American investors and only as an afterthought of impartial justice and helpful friendship. Its policy was provincial in all things; its purposes were out of harmony with the temper and purpose of the people and the timely development of the nation’s interests.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">So things stood when the Democratic Party came into power. How do they stand now? Alike in the domestic field and in the wide field of the commerce of the world, American business and life and industry have been set free to move as they never moved before.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The tariff has been revised, not on the principle of repelling foreign trade, but upon the principle of encouraging it, upon something like a footing of equality with our own in respect of the terms of competition, and a Tariff Board has been created whose function it will be to keep the relations of American with foreign business and industry under constant observation, for the guidance alike of our business men and of our Congress. American energies are now directed towards the markets of the world.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The laws against trusts have been clarified by definition, with a view to making it plain that they were not directed against big business but only against unfair business and the pretense of competition where there was none; and a Trade Commission has been created with powers of guidance and accommodation which have relieved business men of unfounded fears and set them upon the road of hopeful and confident enterprise.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">By the Federal Reserve Act the supply of currency at the disposal of active business has been rendered elastic, taking its volume, not from a fixed body of investment securities, but from the liquid assets of daily trade; and these assets are assessed and accepted, not by distant groups of bankers in control of unavailable reserves, but by bankers at the many centres of local exchange who are in touch with local conditions everywhere.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Effective measures have been taken for the re-creation of an American merchant marine and the revival of the American carrying trade indispensable to our emancipation from the control which foreigners have so long exercised over the opportunities, the routes, and the methods of our commerce with other countries.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The Interstate Commerce Commission is about to be reorganized to enable it to perform its great and important functions more promptly and more efficiently. We have created, extended and improved the service of the parcels post.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">So much we have done for business. What other party has understood the task so well or executed it so intelligently and energetically? What other party has attempted it at all? The Republican leaders, apparently, know of no means of assisting business but “protection.” How to stimulate it and put it upon a new footing of energy and enterprise they have not suggested.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">For the farmers of the country we have virtually created commercial credit, by means of the Federal Reserve Act and the Rural Credits Act. They now have the standing of other business men in the money market. We have successfully regulated speculation in “futures” and established standards in the marketing of grains. By an intelligent Warehouse Act we have assisted to make the standard crops available as never before both for systematic marketing and as a security for loans from the banks. We have greatly added to the work of neighborhood demonstration on the farm itself of improved methods of cultivation, and, through the intelligent extension of the functions of the Department of Agriculture, have made it possible for the farmer to learn systematically where his best markets are and how to get at them.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The workingmen of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> have been given a veritable emancipation, by the legal recognition of a man’s <word altform="labor">labour</word> as part of his life, and not a mere marketable commodity; by exempting <word altform="labor">labour</word> organizations from processes of the courts which treated their members like fractional parts of mobs and not like accessible and responsible individuals; by releasing our seamen from involuntary servitude; by making adequate provision for compensation for industrial accidents; by providing suitable machinery for mediation and conciliation in industrial disputes; and by putting the Federal Department of Labor at the disposal of the workingman when in search of work.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">We have effected the emancipation of the children of the country by releasing them from hurtful <word altform="labor">labour</word>. We have instituted a system of national aid in the building of highroads such as the country has been feeling after for a century. We have sought to equalize taxation by means of an equitable income tax. We have taken the steps that ought to have been taken at the outset to open up the resources of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Alaska</place>. We have provided for national defense upon a scale never before seriously proposed upon the responsibility of an entire political party. We have driven the tariff lobby from cover and obliged it to substitute solid argument for private influence.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">This extraordinary recital must sound like a platform, a list of sanguine promises; but it is not. It is a record of promises made four years ago and now actually redeemed in constructive legislation.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">These things must profoundly disturb the thoughts and confound the plans of those who have made themselves believe that the Democratic Party neither understood nor was ready to assist the business of the country in the great enterprises which it is its evident and inevitable destiny to undertake and carry through. The breaking up of the lobby must especially disconcert them: for it was through the lobby that they sought and were sure they had found the heart of things. The game of privilege can be played successfully by no other means.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">This record must equally astonish those who feared that the Democratic Party had not opened its heart to comprehend the demands of social justice. We have in four years come very near to carrying out the platform of the Progressive Party as well as our own; for we also are progressives.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">There is one circumstance connected with this <word altform="program">programme</word> which ought to be very plainly stated. It was resisted at every step by the interests which the Republican Party had catered to and fostered at the expense of the country, and these same interests are now earnestly praying for a reaction which will save their privileges,—for the restoration of their sworn friends to power before it is too late to recover what they have lost. They fought with particular desperation and infinite resourcefulness the reform of the banking and currency system, knowing that to be the citadel of their control; and most anxiously are they hoping and planning for the amendment of the Federal Reserve Act by the concentration of control in a single bank which the old familiar group of bankers can keep under their eye and direction. But while the “big men” who used to write the tariffs and command the assistance of the Treasury have been hostile,—all but a few with vision,—the average business man knows that he has been delivered, and that the fear that was once every day in his heart, that the men who controlled credit and directed enterprise from the committee rooms of Congress would crush him, is there no more, and will not return,—unless the party that consulted only the “big men” should return to power,—the party of masterly inactivity and cunning resourcefulness in standing pat to resist change.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The Republican Party is just the party that <render as="italic" rend="inherit">cannot</render> meet the new conditions of a new age. It does not know the way and it does not wish new conditions. It tried to break away from the old leaders and could not. They still select its candidates and dictate its policy, still resist change, still hanker after the old conditions, still know no methods of encouraging business but the old methods. When it changes its leaders and its purposes and brings its ideas up to date it will have the right to ask the American people to give it power again; but not until then. A new age, an age of revolutionary change, needs new purposes and new ideas.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">In foreign affairs we have been guided by principles clearly conceived and consistently lived up to. Perhaps they have not been fully comprehended because they have hitherto governed international affairs only in theory, not in practice. They are simple, obvious, easily stated, and fundamental to American ideals.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">We have been neutral not only because it was the fixed and traditional policy of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> to stand aloof from the politics of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Europe</place> and because we had had no part either of action or of policy in the influences which brought on <word altform="World War I">the present war</word>, but also because it was manifestly our duty to prevent, if it were possible, the indefinite extension of the fires of hate and desolation kindled by that terrible conflict and seek to serve mankind by reserving our strength and our resources for the anxious and difficult days of restoration and healing which must follow, when peace will have to build its house anew.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The rights of our own citizens of course became involved: that was inevitable. Where they did this was our guiding principle: that property rights can be vindicated by claims for damages and no modern nation can decline to arbitrate such claims; but the fundamental rights of humanity cannot be. The loss of life is irreparable. Neither can direct violations of a nation’s sovereignty await vindication in suits for damages. The nation that violates these essential rights must expect to be checked and called to account by direct challenge and resistance. It at once makes the quarrel in part our own. These are plain principles and we have never lost sight of them or departed from them, whatever the stress or the perplexity of circumstance or the provocation to hasty resentment. The record is clear and consistent throughout and stands distinct and definite for anyone to judge who wishes to know the truth about it.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The seas were not broad enough to keep the infection of the conflict out of our own politics. The passions and intrigues of certain active groups and combinations of men amongst us who were born under foreign flags injected the poison of disloyalty into our own most critical affairs, laid violent hands upon many of our industries, and subjected us to the shame of divisions of sentiment and purpose in which <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> was <word altform="condemned">contemned</word> and forgotten. It is part of the business of this year of reckoning and settlement to speak plainly and act with unmistakable purpose in rebuke of these things, in order that they may be forever hereafter impossible. I am the candidate of a party, but I am above all things else an American citizen. I neither seek the <word altform="favor">favour</word> nor fear the displeasure of that small alien element amongst us which puts loyalty to any foreign power before loyalty to the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place>.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">While <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Europe</place> was at <word altform="World War I">war</word> our own continent, one of our own <word altform="neighbors">neighbours</word>, was shaken by revolution. In that matter, too, principle was plain and it was imperative that we should live up to it if we were to deserve the trust of any real partisan of the right as free men see it. We have professed to believe, and we do believe, that the people of small and weak states have the right to expect to be dealt with exactly as the people of big and powerful states would be. We have acted upon that principle in dealing with the people of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Mexico</place>.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Our recent pursuit of bandits into Mexican territory was no violation of that principle. We ventured to enter Mexican territory only because there were no military forces in <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Mexico</place> that could protect our border from hostile attack and our own people from violence, and we have committed there no single act of hostility or interference even with the sovereign authority of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Republic of Mexico</place> herself. It was a plain case of the violation of our own sovereignty which could not wait to be vindicated by damages and for which there was no other remedy. The authorities of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Mexico</place> were powerless to prevent it.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Many serious wrongs against the property, many irreparable wrongs against the persons, of Americans have been committed within the territory of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Mexico</place> herself during this confused revolution, wrongs which could not be effectually checked so long as there was no constituted power in <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Mexico</place> which was in a position to check them. We could not act directly in that matter ourselves without denying Mexicans the right to any revolution at all which disturbed us and making the emancipation of her own people await our own interest and convenience.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">For it is their emancipation that they are seeking,—blindly, it may be, and as yet ineffectually, but with profound and passionate purpose and within their unquestionable right, apply what true American principle you will,—any principle that an American would publicly avow. The people of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Mexico</place> have not been suffered to own their own country or direct their own institutions. Outsiders, men out of other nations and with interests too often alien to their own, have dictated what their privileges and opportunities should be and who should control their land, their lives, and their resources,—some of them Americans, pressing for things they could never have got in their own country. The Mexican people are entitled to attempt their liberty from such influences; and so long as I have anything to do with the action of our great Government I shall do everything in my power to prevent anyone standing in their way. I know that this is hard for some persons to understand; but it is not hard for the plain people of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> to understand. It is hard doctrine only for those who wish to get something for themselves out of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Mexico</place>. There are men, and noble women, too, not a few, of our own people, thank God! whose fortunes are invested in great properties in <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Mexico</place> who yet see the case with true vision and assess its issues with true American feeling. The rest can be left for the present out of the reckoning until this enslaved people has had its day of struggle towards the light. I have heard no one who was free from such influences propose interference by the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> with the internal affairs of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Mexico</place>. Certainly no friend of the Mexican people has proposed it.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The people of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> are capable of great sympathies and a noble pity in dealing with problems of this kind. As their spokesman and representative, I have tried to act in the spirit they would wish me show. The people of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Mexico</place> are striving for the rights that are fundamental to life and happiness,—fifteen million oppressed men, overburdened women, and pitiful children in virtual bondage in their own home of fertile lands and inexhaustible treasure! Some of the leaders of the revolution may often have been mistaken and violent and selfish, but the revolution itself was inevitable and is right. The unspeakable <person refurl="x4002421" reg="Victoriano Huerta" link-pointer-type="person">Huerta</person> betrayed the very comrades he served, traitorously overthrew the government of which he was a trusted part, impudently spoke for the very forces that had driven his people to the rebellion with which he had pretended to sympathize. The men who overcame him and drove him out represent at least the fierce passion of reconstruction which lies at the very heart of liberty; and so long as they represent, however imperfectly, such a struggle for deliverance, I am ready to serve their ends when I can. So long as the power of recognition rests with me the Government of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> will refuse to extend the hand of welcome to any one who obtains power in a sister republic by treachery and violence. No permanency can be given the affairs of any republic by a title based upon intrigue and assassination. I declared that to be the policy of this Administration within three weeks after I assumed the presidency. I here again vow it. I am more interested in the fortunes of oppressed men and pitiful women and children than in any property rights whatever. Mistakes I have no doubt made in this perplexing business, but not in purpose or object.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">More is involved than the immediate destinies of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Mexico</place> and the relations of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> with a distressed and distracted people. All <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> looks on. Test is now being made of us whether we be sincere lovers of popular liberty or not and are indeed to be trusted to respect national sovereignty among our weaker <word>neighbours</word>. We have undertaken these many years to play big brother to the republics of this hemisphere. This is the day of our test whether we mean, or have ever meant, to play that part for our own benefit wholly or also for theirs. Upon the outcome of that test (its outcome in their minds, not in ours) depends every relationship of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> with <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Latin America</place>, whether in politics or in commerce and enterprise. These are great issues and lie at the heart of the gravest tasks of the future, tasks both economic and political and very intimately inwrought with many of the most vital of the new issues of the politics of the world. The republics of America have in the last three years been drawing together in a new spirit of accommodation, mutual understanding, and cordial cooperation. Much of the politics of the world in the years to come will depend upon their relationships with one another. It is a barren and provincial statesmanship that loses sight of such things!</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The future, the immediate future, will bring us squarely face to face with many great and exacting problems which will search us through and through whether we be able and ready to play the part in the world that we mean to play. It will not bring us into their presence slowly, gently, with ceremonious introduction, but suddenly and at once, the moment <word altform="World War I">the war</word> in <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Europe</place> is over. They will be new problems, most of them; many will be old problems in a new setting and with new elements which we have never dealt with or reckoned the force and meaning of before. They will require for their solution new thinking, fresh courage and resourcefulness, and in some matters radical reconsiderations of policy. We must be ready to mobilize our resources alike of brains and of materials.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">It is not a future to be afraid of. It is, rather, a future to stimulate and excite us to the display of the best powers that are in us. We may enter it with confidence when we are sure that we understand it,—and we have provided ourselves already with the means of understanding it.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Look first at what it will be necessary that the nations of the world should do to make the days to come tolerable and fit to live and work in; and then look at our part in what is to follow and our own duty of preparation. For we must be prepared both in resources and in policy.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">There must be a just and settled peace, and we here in <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> must contribute the full force of our enthusiasm and of our authority as a nation to the organization of that peace upon world-wide foundations that cannot easily be shaken. No nation should be forced to take sides in any quarrel in which its own <word altform="honor">honour</word> and integrity and the fortunes of its own people are not involved; but no nation can any longer remain neutral as against any wilful disturbance of the peace of the world. The effects of war can no longer be confined to the areas of battle. No nation stands wholly apart in interest when the life and interests of all nations are thrown into confusion and peril. If hopeful and generous enterprise is to be renewed, if the healing and helpful arts of life are indeed to be revived when peace comes again, a new atmosphere of justice and friendship must be generated by means the world has never tried before. The nations of the world must unite in joint guarantees that whatever is done to disturb the whole world’s life must first be tested in the court of the whole world’s opinion before it is attempted.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">These are the new foundations the world must build for itself, and we must play our part in the reconstruction, generously and without too much thought of our separate interests. We must make ourselves ready to play it intelligently, <word altform="vigorously">vigourously</word> and well.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">One of the contributions we must make to the world’s peace is this: We must see to it that the people in our insular possessions are treated in their own lands as we would treat them here, and make the rule of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> mean the same thing everywhere,—the same justice, the same consideration for the essential rights of men.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Besides contributing our ungrudging moral and practical support to the establishment of peace throughout the world we must actively and intelligently prepare ourselves to do our full service in the trade and industry which are to sustain and develop the life of the nations in the days to come.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">We have already been provident in this great matter and supplied ourselves with the instrumentalities of prompt adjustment. We have created, in the Federal Trade Commission, a means of inquiry and of accommodation in the field of commerce which ought both to coordinate the enterprises of our traders and manufacturers and to remove the barriers of misunderstanding and of a too technical interpretation of the law. In the new Tariff Commission we have added another instrumentality of observation and adjustment which promises to be immediately serviceable. The Trade Commission substitutes counsel and accommodation for the harsher processes of legal restraint, and the Tariff Commission ought to substitute facts for prejudices and theories. Our exporters have for some time had the advantage of working in the new light thrown upon foreign markets and opportunities of trade by the intelligent inquiries and activities of the Bureau of Foreign and Domestic Commerce which the Democratic Congress so wisely created in <date value="1912-99-99">1912</date>. The Tariff Commission completes the machinery by which we shall be enabled to open up our legislative policy to the facts as they develop.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">We can no longer indulge our traditional provincialism. We are to play a leading part in the world drama whether we wish it or not. We shall lend, not borrow; act for ourselves, not imitate or follow; organize and initiate, not peep about merely to see where we may get in.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">We have already formulated and agreed upon a policy of law which will explicitly remove the ban now supposed to rest upon cooperation amongst our exporters in seeking and securing their proper place in the markets of the world. The field will be free, the instrumentalities at hand. It will only remain for the masters of enterprise amongst us to act in energetic concert, and for the Government of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> to insist upon the maintenance throughout the world of those conditions of fairness and of even-handed justice in the commercial dealings of the nations with one another upon which, after all, in the last analysis, the peace and ordered life of the world must ultimately depend.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">At home also we must see to it that the men who plan and develop and direct our business enterprises shall enjoy definite and settled conditions of law, a policy accommodated to the freest progress. We have set the just and necessary limits. We have put all kinds of unfair competition under the ban and penalty of the law. We have barred monopoly. These fatal and ugly things being excluded, we must now quicken action and facilitate enterprise by every just means within our choice. There will be peace in the business world, and, with peace, revived confidence and life.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">We ought both to husband and to develop our natural resources, our mines, our forests, our water power. I wish we could have made more progress than we have made in this vital matter; and I call once more, with the deepest earnestness and solicitude, upon the advocates of a careful and provident conservation, on the one hand, and the advocates of a free and inviting field for private capital, on the other, to get together in a spirit of genuine accommodation and agreement and set this great policy forward at once.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">We must hearten and quicken the spirit and efficiency of <word altform="labor">labour</word> throughout our whole industrial system by everywhere and in all occupations doing justice to the <word altform="laborer">labourer</word>, not only by paying a living wage but also by making all the conditions that surround <word altform="labor">labour</word> what they ought to be. And we must do more than justice. We must safeguard life and promote health and safety in every occupation in which they are threatened or imperilled. That is more than justice, and better, because it is humanity and economy.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">We must coordinate the railway systems of the country for national use, and must facilitate and promote their development with a view to that co-ordination and to their better adaptation as a whole to the life and trade and defense of the nation. The life and industry of the country can be free and unhampered only if these arteries are open, efficient, and complete.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Thus shall we stand ready to meet the future as circumstance and international policy effect their unfolding, whether the changes come slowly or come fast and without preface.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I have not spoken explicitly, Gentlemen, of the platform adopted at <place reg="St. Louis, MO" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">St. Louis</place>; but it has been implicit in all that I have said. I have sought to interpret its spirit and meaning. The people of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> do not need to be assured now that that platform is a definite pledge, a practical <word altform="program">programme</word>. We have proved to them that our promises are made to be kept.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">We hold very definite ideals. We believe that the energy and initiative of our people have been too narrowly coached and superintended; that they should be set free, as we have set them free, to disperse themselves throughout the nation; that they should not be concentrated in the hands of a few powerful guides and guardians, as our opponents have again and again, in effect if not in purpose, sought to concentrate them. We believe, moreover,—who that looks about him now with comprehending eye can fail to believe?—that the day of Little Americanism, with its narrow horizons, when methods of “protection” and industrial nursing were the chief study of our provincial statesmen, are past and gone and that a day of enterprise has at last dawned for the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> whose field is the wide world.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">We hope to see the stimulus of that new day draw all <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place>, the republics of both continents, on to a new life and energy and initiative in the great affairs of peace. We are Americans for Big America, and rejoice to look forward to the days in which <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> shall strive to stir the world without irritating it or drawing it on to new antagonisms, when the nations with which we deal shall at last come to see upon what deep foundations of humanity and justice our passion for peace rests, and when all mankind shall look upon our great people with a new sentiment of admiration, friendly rivalry and real affection, as upon a people who, though keen to succeed, seeks always to be at once generous and just and to whom humanity is dearer than profit or selfish power.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Upon this record and in the faith of this purpose we go to the country.</p>

         <p rend="noindent" xml:space="preserve"><render as="smallcap" rend="inherit">Madam President, Ladies of the Association</render>:</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I have found it a real privilege to be here to-night and to listen to the addresses which you have heard. Though you may not all of you believe it, I would a great deal rather hear somebody else speak than speak myself; but I should feel that I was omitting a duty if I did not address you to-night and say some of the things that have been in my thought as I realized the approach of this evening and the duty that would fall upon me.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The astonishing thing about the movement which you represent is, not that it has grown so slowly, but that it has grown so rapidly. No doubt for those who have been a long time in the struggle, like your honored president, it seems a long and arduous path that has been trodden, but when you think of the cumulating force of this movement in recent decades, you must agree with me that it is one of the most astonishing tides in modern history. Two generations ago, no doubt Madam President will agree with me in saying, it was a handful of women who were fighting this cause. Now it is a great multitude of women who are fighting it.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">And there are some interesting historical connections which I would like to attempt to point out to you. One of the most striking facts about the history of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> is that at the outset it was a lawyers’ history. Almost all of the questions to which <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> addressed itself, say a hundred years ago, were legal questions, were questions of method, not questions of what you were going to do with your Government, but questions of how you were going to constitute your Government,—how you were going to balance the powers of the States and the Federal Government, how you were going to balance the claims of property against the processes of liberty, how you were going to make your governments up so as to balance the parts against each other so that the legislature would check the executive, and the executive the legislature, and the courts both of them put together. The whole conception of government when the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> became a Nation was a mechanical conception of government, and the mechanical conception of government which underlay it was the Newtonian theory of the universe. If you pick up the <name type="title">Federalist</name>, some parts of it read like a treatise on astronomy instead of a treatise on government. They speak of the centrifugal and the centripital forces, and locate the President somewhere in a rotating system. The whole thing is a calculation of power and an adjustment of parts. There was a time when nobody but a lawyer could know enough to run the Government of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place>, and a distinguished English publicist once remarked, speaking of the complexity of the American Government, that it was no proof of the excellence of the American Constitution that it had been successfully operated, because the Americans could run any constitution. But there have been a great many technical difficulties in running it.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">And then something happened. A great question arose in this country which, though complicated with legal elements, was at bottom a human question, and nothing but a question of humanity. That was the slavery question. And is it not significant that it was then, and then for the first time, that women became prominent in politics in <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place>? Not many women; those prominent in that day were so few that you can name them over in a brief catalogue, but, nevertheless, they then began to play a part in writing, not only, but in public speech, which was a very novel part for women to play in <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place>. After the Civil War had settled some of what seemed to be the most difficult legal questions of our system, the life of the Nation began not only to unfold, but to accumulate. Life in the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> was a comparatively simple matter at the time of the Civil War. There was none of that underground struggle which is now so manifest to those who look only a little way beneath the surface. Stories such as <person link-pointer-type="person">Dr. Davis</person> has told to-night were uncommon in those simpler days. The pressure of low wages, the agony of obscure and unremunerated toil, did not exist in <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> in anything like the same proportions that they exist now. And as our life has unfolded and accumulated, as the contacts of it have become hot, as the populations have assembled in the cities, and the cool spaces of the country have been supplanted by the feverish urban areas, the whole nature of our political questions has been altered. They have ceased to be legal questions. They have more and more become social questions, questions with regard to the relations of human beings to one another,—not merely their legal relations, but their moral and spiritual relations to one another. This has been most characteristic of American life in the last few decades, and as these questions have assumed greater and greater prominence, the movement which this association represents has gathered cumulative force. So that, if anybody asks himself, “What does this gathering force mean,” if he knows anything about the history of the country, he knows that it means something that has not only come to stay, but has come with conquering power.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I get a little impatient sometimes about the discussion of the channels and methods by which it is to prevail. It is going to prevail, and that is a very superficial and ignorant view of it which attributes it to mere social unrest. It is not merely because the women are discontented. It is because the women have seen visions of duty, and that is something which we not only can not resist, but, if we be true Americans, we do not wish to resist. <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> took its origin in visions of the human spirit, in aspirations for the deepest sort of liberty of the mind and of the heart, and as visions of that sort come up to the sight of those who are spiritually minded in <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place>, <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> comes more and more into her birthright and into the perfection of her development.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">So that what we have to realize in dealing with forces of this sort is that we are dealing with the substance of life itself. I have felt as I sat here to-night the wholesome contagion of the occasion. Almost every other time that I ever visited <place reg="Atlantic City, NJ" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Atlantic City</place>, I came to fight somebody. I hardly know how to conduct myself when I have not come to fight against anybody, but with somebody. I have come to suggest, among other things, that when the forces of nature are steadily working and the tide is rising to meet the moon, you need not be afraid that it will not come to its flood. We feel the tide; we rejoice in the strength of it; and we shall not quarrel in the long run as to the method of it. Because, when you are working with masses of men and organized bodies of opinion, you have got to carry the organized body along. The whole art and practice of government consists, not in moving individuals, but in moving masses. It is all very well to run ahead and beckon, but, after all, you have got to wait for the body to follow. I have not come to ask you to be patient, because you have been, but I have come to congratulate you that there was a force behind you that will beyond any peradventure be triumphant, and for which you can afford a little while to wait.</p>

         <p rend="noindent" xml:space="preserve"><render as="smallcap" rend="inherit">Mr. Chairman, Gentlemen of the Association, Ladies and Gentlemen</render>:</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">It is a matter of sincere gratification to me that I can come and address an association of this sort, and yet I feel that there is a certain drawback to the present occasion. That drawback consists of the fact that it occurs in the midst of a political campaign. Nothing so seriously interrupts or interferes with the sober and sincere consideration of public questions as a political campaign. I want to say to you at the outset that I believe in <render as="italic" rend="inherit">party</render> action, but that I have a supreme contempt for <render as="italic" rend="inherit">partisan</render> action; that I believe that it is necessary for men to concert measures together in organized cooperation by party, but that whenever party feeling touches any one of the passions that work against the general interest, it is altogether to be condemned. Therefore, I feel that on occasions like this we should divest ourselves of the consciousness that we are in the midst of a political campaign, because associations like this are not gathered together to take part in partisan discussion, but to consider those permanent interests of the Nation which concern us all the time, which do not alter their aspects because parties are contesting for power; and that we ought as much as possible on all occasions to think of ourselves as first of all men devoted to the welfare of the country and as compared with that devoted to nothing else whatever.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">What I have come to say to you to-day, therefore, I would wish to say in an atmosphere from which all the vapors of passions have been cleared away, for I want to speak to you about the business situation of the world, so far as <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> is concerned. I am not going to take the liberty of discussing that business situation from the special point of view of your association, because I know that I would be bringing coals to <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Newcastle</place>. I know that I am speaking to men who understand the relation of the grain business to the business of the world very much better than I do; and I know that it is true that, except under very unusual circumstances such as have existed in the immediate past, the export of grain from this country has been a diminishing part of our foreign commerce rather than an increasing part; that the increase of our own population,—the decrease in proportion to that increase, of our production of grains,—has been rendering the question of foreign markets less important, though still very important, than it was in past generations, so far as the dealing in grain is concerned. I also remember, however, that we have only begun in this country the process by which the full production of our agricultural acreage is to be obtained. The agricultural acreage of this country ought to produce twice what it is now producing, and under the stimulation and instruction which have recently been characteristic of agricultural development I think we can confidently predict that within, let us say, a couple of decades the agricultural production of this country will be something like double, whereas, there is no likelihood that the population of this country will be doubled within the same period. You can look forward, therefore, it seems to me, with some degree of confidence to an increasing, and perhaps a rapidly increasing, volume of the products in which you deal.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">But, as I have said, I have not come to discuss that. I have come to discuss the general relation of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> to the business of the world in the decades immediately ahead of us. We have swung out, my fellow citizens, into a new business era in <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place>. I suppose that there is no man connected with your association who does not remember the time when the whole emphasis of American business discussion was laid upon the domestic market. I need not remind you how recently it has happened that our attention has been extended to the markets of the world; much less recently, I need not say, in the matters with which you are concerned than in the other export interests of the country. But it happened that American production, not only in the agricultural field and in mining and in all the natural products of the earth, but also in manufacture, increased in recent years to such a volume that American business burst its jacket. It could not any longer be taken care of within the field of the domestic markets; and when that began to disclose itself as the situation, we also became aware that American business men had not studied foreign markets, that they did not know the commerce of the world, and that they did not have the ships in which to take their proportionate part in the carrying trade of the world; that our merchant marine had sunk to a negligible amount, and that it had sunk to its lowest at the very time when the tide of our exports began to grow in most formidable volume.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">One of the most interesting circumstances of our business history is this: The banking laws of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place>,—I mean the Federal banking laws,—did not put the national banks in a position to do foreign exchange under favorable conditions, and it was actually true that private banks, and sometimes branch banks drawn out of other countries, notably out of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Canada</place>, were established at our chief ports to do what American bankers ought to have done. It was as if <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> was not only unaccustomed to touching all the nerves of the world’s business, but was disinclined to touch them, and had not prepared the instrumentality by which it might take part in the great commerce of the round globe. Only in very recent years have we been even studying the problem of providing ourselves with the instrumentalities. Not until the recent legislation of Congress known as the Federal reserve act were the Federal banks of this country given the proper equipment through which they could assist American commerce, not only in our own country, but in any part of the world where they chose to set up branch institutions. British banks had been serving British merchants all over the world, German banks had been serving German merchants all over the world, and no national bank of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> had been serving American merchants anywhere in the world except in the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place>. We had, as it were, deliberately refrained from playing our part in the field in which we prided ourselves that we were most ambitious and most expert, the field of manufacture and of commerce. All that is past, and the scene has been changed by the events of the last two years, almost suddenly, and with a completeness that almost daunts the planning mind. Not only when this <abbr expan="World War I">war</abbr> is over, but now, <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> has her place in the world and must take her place in the world of finance and commerce upon a scale that she never dreamed of before.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">My dream is that she will take her place in that great field in a new spirit which the world has never seen before; not the spirit of those who would exclude others, but the spirit of those who would excel others. I want to see <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> pitted against the world, not in selfishness, but in brains. The first thing that brains have to feed upon is knowledge, and when I hear men proposing to deal with the business problems of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> in the future as we dealt with them in the past, I do not have to inquire any further whether they are equipped with knowledge. I dismiss them from the reckoning, because I know that the facts are going to dominate and they know nothing about the facts. And the most that we can supply ourselves with just now is, not the detailed program of policy, but the instrumentalities of gaining thorough knowledge of what we are about. Every man of us must for some time to come be “from <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Missouri</place>!” We must want to know what the facts are, and when we know what the facts are we shall know what the policy ought to be.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">What instrumentalities have we provided ourselves with in order that we may be equipped with knowledge? There has been an instrumentality in operation for four or five years of which, strangely enough, American business men have only slowly become aware. Some four or five years ago the Congress established, in connection with the department which was then the Department of Commerce and Labor (now the Department of Commerce), a Bureau of Foreign and Domestic Commerce, and one of the advantages which the American Government has derived from that bureau is that it has been able to hire brains for much less than the brains were worth. It is in a way a national discredit to us, my fellow citizens, that we are paying studious men, capable of understanding anything and of conducting any business, just about one-third of what they could command in the field of business; and it is one of the admirable circumstances of American life that they are proud to serve the Government on a pittance. There are such men in the Bureau of Foreign and Domestic Commerce. They have been studying the foreign commerce of this country as it was never studied before, and have been making reports so comprehensive and so thorough that they compare to their great advantage with the reports of any similar bureau of any other government in the world, and I have found to my amazement that some of the best of those reports seem never to have been read. All you have to do in order to find out the details of some of the greatest fields of activity in the world in the matter of business is to resort to the Bureau of Foreign and Domestic Commerce; but there again the phenomena that I have been speaking of have displayed themselves in a very remarkable way. It needed the catastrophe and the tragedy of this war to awaken American business men to the fact that these were the things which they must know and know at once.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">And then, in addition to that, there was recently created the Federal Trade Commission. It is hard to describe the functions of that commission; all I can say is that it has transformed the Government of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> from being an antagonist of business into being a friend of business. A few years ago American business men,—I think you will corroborate this statement,—took up their morning paper with some degree of nervousness to see what the Government was doing to them. I ask you if you take up the morning paper now with any degree of nervousness? And I ask you if you have not found, those of you who have dealt with it all, the Federal Trade Commission to be put there to show you the way in which the Government can help you and not the way in which the Government can hinder you?</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">But that is not the matter that I am most interested in. It has always been a fiction,—I don’t know who invented it or why he invented it,—that there was a contest between the law and business. There has always been a contest in every government between the law and bad business, and I do not want to see that contest softened in any way; but there has never been any contest between men who intended the right thing and the men who administered the law. But what I want to speak about is this: One of the functions of the Federal Trade Commission is to inquire with the fullest powers ever conferred upon a similar commission in this country into all the circumstances of American business for the purpose of doing for American business exactly what the Department of Agriculture has so long and with increasing efficiency done for the farmer, inform the American business man of every element, big and little, with which it is his duty to deal. Here are created searching eyes of inquiry to do the very thing that it was imperatively necessary and immediately necessary that the country should do,—look upon the field of business and know what was going on!</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">And then, in the third place, you know that we have just now done what it was common sense to do about the tariff. We have not put this into words, but I do not hesitate to put it into words: We have admitted that on the one side and on the other we were talking theories and managing policies without a sufficient knowledge of the facts upon which we were acting, and, therefore, we have established what is intended to be a nonpartisan tariff commission to study the conditions with which legislation has to deal in the matter of the relations of American with foreign business transactions. Another eye created to see the facts! And I am hopeful that I can find the men who will see the facts and state them, no matter whose opinion those facts contradict. For an opinion ought always to have a profound respect for a fact; and when you once get the facts, opinions that are antagonistic to those facts are necessarily defeated. I have never found a really courageous man who was afraid to put his opinion to the test of facts, or a morally sincere man who was not ready to surrender to the facts when they were contrary to his opinion. The Tariff Commission is going to look for the facts no matter who is hurt. We are creating one after another the instrumentalities of knowledge, so that the business men of this country shall know what the field of the world’s business is and deal with that field upon that knowledge.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Then, when the knowledge is obtained, what are we going to do? One of the things that interests me most about an association of this sort is that the intention of it is that the members should share a common body of information, and that they should concert among themselves those operations of business which are beneficial to all of them; that, instead of a large number of dealers in grain acting separately and each fighting for his own hand, you are willing to come together and study the problem as if you were partners and brothers and cooperators in this field of business. That has been going on in every occupation in the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> of any consequence. Even the men that do the advertising have been getting together, and they have made this startling and fundamental discovery, that the only way to advertise successfully is to tell the truth. There are many reasons for that. One of the chief reasons is that when you get found out, it is worse for you than it was before; but the great reason, the sober reason, is that business must be founded on the truth, and you men get together in order to create a clearing house for the truth about your business.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Very well; that is a picture in small of what we must do in the large. We must cooperate in the whole field of business, the Government with the merchant, the merchant with his employee, the whole body of producers with the whole body of consumers, to see that the right things are produced in the right volume and find the right purchasers at the right place, and that, all working together, we realize that nothing can be for the individual benefit which is not for the common benefit.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">You know that there was introduced in the House of Representatives recently a bill, commonly called the Webb bill, for the purpose of stating it as the policy of the law of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> that nothing in the antitrust laws now existing should be interpreted to interfere with the proper sort of cooperation among exporters. The foreign field is not like the domestic field. The foreign field is full of combinations meant to be exclusive. The antitrust laws of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> are intended to prevent any kind of combination in the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> which shall be exclusive of new enterprises within the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place>, any combination which shall set up monopoly in <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place>; but the export business is a very big business, a very complicated business, a very expensive business, and it ought to be possible, and it will be possible and legal, for men engaged in exporting to get together and manage it in groups, so that they can manage it at an advantage instead of at a disadvantage as compared with foreign rivals. Not for the purpose of exclusive and monopolistic combination, but for the purpose of cooperation, and there is a very wide difference there. I for myself despise monopoly, and I have an enthusiasm for cooperation. By cooperation I mean working along with anybody who is willing to work along with you under definite understandings and arrangements which will constitute a sound business program. There can be no jealousy of that, and if there had been time, I can say with confidence that this bill, which passed the House of Representatives, would have passed the Senate of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> also. So that any obstacle that ingenious lawyers may find in the antitrust laws will be removed. I was a lawyer once myself before I reformed; I can divide a hair ’twixt north and northeast side, but I do not think it is worth while, and I do not think that statutes are the places for ingenuity. A statute is intended to lay down a broad and comprehensive and national policy, and it ought to be read in that light. But there would be no fun in punctuation if you had to read it that way! The purpose of legislation in the immediate future in this country is going to be to remove all ingenious constructions and make it perfectly clear what the liberties as well as the restraints of trade are in this country.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">And then there must be cooperation, not only between the Government and the business men, but between business men. Shippers must cooperate, and they ought to be studying right now how to cooperate. There are a great many gentlemen in other countries who can show them how! They ought to look forward, particularly, to caring for this matter, that they have vehicles in which to carry their goods. We must address ourselves immediately and as rapidly as possible to the re-creation of a great American merchant marine. Our present situation is very like this: Suppose that a man who had a great department store did not have any delivery wagons and depended upon his competitors in the same market to deliver his goods to his customers. You know what would happen. They would deliver their own goods first and quickest, and they would deliver yours only if yours were to be delivered upon the routes followed by their wagons. That is an exact picture of what is taking place in our foreign trade at this minute. Foreign vessels carry our goods where they, the foreign vessels, happen to be going, and they carry them only if they have room in addition to what they are carrying for other people. You can not conduct trade that way. That is conducting trade on sufferance. That is conducting trade on an “if you please.” That is conducting trade on the basis of service the point of view of which is not your advantage. Therefore, we can not lose any time in getting delivery wagons.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">There has been a good deal of discussion about this recently, and it has been said, “The Government must not take any direct part in this. You must let private capital do it,” and the reply was, “All right, go ahead.” “Oh, but we will not go ahead unless you help us.” We said, “Very well, then, we will go ahead, but we will not need your help, because we do not want to compete where you are already doing the carrying business, but where you are not doing the carrying business and it has to be done for some time at a loss. We will undertake to do it at a loss until that route is established, and we will give place to private capital whenever private capital is ready to take the place.” That sounds like a very reasonable proposition. “We will carry your goods one way when we have to come back empty the other way and lose money on the voyage, and when there are cargoes both ways and it is profitable to carry them, we shall not insist upon carrying them any longer.”</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">And it is absolutely necessary now to make good our new connections. Our new connections are with the great and rich Republics to the south of us. For the first time in my recollection they are beginning to trust and believe in us and want us, and one of my chief concerns has been to see that nothing was done that did not show friendship and good faith on our part. You know that is used to be the case that if you wanted to travel comfortably in your own person from <place reg="New York, NY" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">New York</place> to a South American port, you had to go by way of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">England</place> or else stow yourself away in some uncomfortable fashion in a ship that took almost as long to go straight, and within whose bowels you got in such a temper before you got there that you did not care whether she got there or not. The great interesting geographical fact to me is that by the opening of the Panama Canal there is a straight line south from <place reg="New York, NY" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">New York</place> through the canal to the western coast of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">South America</place>, which hitherto has been one of the most remote coasts in the world so far as we were concerned. The west coast of South America is now nearer to us than the eastern cost of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">South America</place> ever was, though we have the open Atlantic upon which to approach the east coast. Here is the loom all ready upon which to spread the threads which can be worked into a fabric of friendship and wealth such as we have never known before!</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The real wealth of foreign relationships, my fellow-citizens, whether they be the relationships of trade or any other kind of intercourse, the real wealth of those relationships is the wealth of mutual confidence and understanding. If we do not understand them and they do not understand us, we can not trade with them, much less be their friends, and it is only by weaving these intimate threads of connection that we shall be able to establish that fundamental thing, that psychological, spiritual <render as="italic" rend="inherit">nexus</render> which is, after all, the real warp and woof of trade itself. We have got to have the knowledge, we have got to have the cooperation, and then back of all that has got to lie what <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> has in abundance and only has to release, that is to say, the self-reliant enterprise.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">There is only one thing I have ever been ashamed of about in <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place>, and that was the timidity and fearfulnesss of Americans in the presence of foreign competitors. I have dwelt among Americans all my life and am an intense absorbent of the atmosphere of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place>, and I know by personal experience that there are as effective brains in <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> as anywhere in the world. An American afraid to pit American business men against any competitors anywhere! Enterprise, the shrewdness which Americans have shown, the knowledge of business which they have shown, all these things are going to make for that peaceful and honorable conquest of foreign markets which is our reasonable ambition.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I spoke a moment ago of the Federal Trade Commission. In conference with various business associations, members of that commission have made this astonishing discovery, that in some fields of manufacture at any rate, not 10 per cent of the producers of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> keep accurate cost accounts. They do not know how much each part of their operation costs them. They have not analyzed their business in such a way as to know where economy can be substituted for waste, or where efficiency can take the place of inefficiency, and one of the things that is going to happen, now that we are going to be up against the expert cost accountants of the world, is that we are going to become first-class economists, and that American labor, already distinguished for its efficiency, is going to double and treble that efficiency. When that takes place and this great stimulating air of the world’s competitive brains has wrought its effects upon us, we are going to be, I hope, what the world has never seen yet, a body of men who do not want to prevail by the backing of their Government but by the backing of their skill and knowledge.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">A friend of mine was once invited to attend a peace meeting. He said he would come with pleasure if he might be permitted to explain that most of the men sitting on the platform were engaged in fomenting war, and when he was asked to explain this pleasing meaning, he said, “I have looked over the list of the men who constitute your executive committee and almost every one of them is engaged in doing things to excite the hostility and disturb the national feeling of men in foreign countries, particularly in the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Orient</place>, which will inevitably lead to war sooner or later.” The competitions of the modern world that are lasting are not the competitions of physical force. They are the competitions of intellectual force. The competitions of business either lay the foundations of respect and mutual confidence or the foundations of suspicion and mutual hostility.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve"><place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> has stood in the years past for that sort of political understanding among men which would let every man feel that his rights were the same as those of another and as good as those of another, and the mission of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> in the field of the world’s commerce is to be the same, that when an American comes into that competition he comes without any arms that would enable him to conquer by force, but only with those peaceful influences of intelligence, a desire to serve, a knowledge of what he is about, before which everything softens and yields and renders itself subject. That is the mission of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place>, and my interest, so far as my small part in American affairs is concerned, is to lend every bit of intelligence I have to this interesting, this vital, this all-important matter of releasing the intelligence of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> for the service of mankind.</p>

         <p rend="noindent" xml:space="preserve"><render as="smallcap" rend="inherit">Gentlemen of the Congress</render>:</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">In fulfilling at this time the duty laid upon me by the Constitution of communicating to you from time to time information of the state of the Union and recommending to your consideration such legislative measures as may be judged necessary and expedient I shall continue the practice, which I hope has been acceptable to you, of leaving to the reports of the several heads of the executive departments the elaboration of the detailed needs of the public service and confine myself to those matters of more general public policy with which it seems necessary and feasible to deal at the present session of the Congress.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I realize the limitations of time under which you will necessarily act at this session and shall make my suggestions as few as possible; but there were some things left undone at the last session which there will now be time to complete and which it seems necessary in the interest of the public to do at once.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">In the first place, it seems to me imperatively necessary that the earliest possible consideration and action should be accorded the remaining measures of the <word altform="program">programme</word> of settlement and regulation which I had occasion to recommend to you at the close of your last session in view of the public dangers disclosed by the unaccommodated difficulties which then existed, and which still unhappily continue to exist, between the railroads of the country and their locomotive engineers, conductors, and trainmen.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I then recommended:</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">First, immediate provision for the enlargement and administrative reorganization of the Interstate Commerce Commission along the lines embodied in the bill recently passed by the House of Representatives and now awaiting action by the Senate; in order that the Commission may be enabled to deal with the many great and various duties now devolving upon it with a promptness and thoroughness which are, with its present constitution and means of action, practically impossible.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Second, the establishment of an eight-hour day as the legal basis alike of work and of wages in the employment of all railway employees who are actually engaged in the work of operating trains in interstate transportation.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Third, the authorization of the appointment by <personRef refurl="x4000418" reg="Woodrow Wilson" link-pointer-type="person">the President</personRef> of a small body of men to observe the actual results in experience of the adoption of the eight-hour day in railway transportation alike for the men and for the railroads.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Fourth, explicit approval by the Congress of the consideration by the Interstate Commerce Commission of an increase of freight rates to meet such additional expenditures by the railroads as may have been rendered necessary by the adoption of the eight-hour day and which have not been offset by administrative readjustments and economies, should the facts disclosed justify the increase.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Fifth, an amendment of the existing federal statute which provides for the mediation, conciliation, and arbitration of such controversies as the present by adding to it a provision that, in case the methods of accommodation now provided for should fail, a full public investigation of the merits of every such dispute shall be instituted and completed before a strike or lockout may lawfully be attempted.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">And, sixth, the lodgement in the hands of the Executive of the power, in case of military necessity, to take control of such portions and such rolling stock of the railways of the country as may be required for military use and to operate them for military purposes, with authority to draft into the military service of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> such train crews and administrative officials as the circumstances require for their safe and efficient use.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The second and third of these recommendations the Congress immediately acted on: it established the eight-hour day as the legal basis of work and wages in train service and it authorized the appointment of a commission to observe and report upon the practical results, deeming these the measures most immediately needed; but it postponed action upon the other suggestions until an opportunity should be offered for a more deliberate consideration of them. The fourth recommendation I do not deem it necessary to renew. The power of the Interstate Commerce Commission to grant an increase of rates on the ground referred to is indisputably clear and a recommendation by the Congress with regard to such a matter might seem to draw in question the scope of the Commission’s authority or its inclination to do justice when there is no reason to doubt either.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The other suggestions,—the increase in the Interstate Commerce Commission’s membership and in its facilities for performing its manifold duties, the provision for full public investigation and assessment of industrial disputes, and the grant to the Executive of the power to control and operate the railways when necessary in time of war or other like public necessity,—I now very earnestly renew.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The necessity for such legislation is manifest and pressing. Those who have entrusted us with the responsibility and duty of serving and safeguarding them in such matters would find it hard, I believe, to excuse a failure to act upon these grave matters or any unnecessary postponement of action upon them.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Not only does the Interstate Commerce Commission now find it practically impossible, with its present membership and organization, to perform its great functions promptly and thoroughly but it is not unlikely that it may presently be found advisable to add to its duties still others equally heavy and exacting. It must first be perfected as an administrative instrument.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The country cannot and should not consent to remain any longer exposed to profound industrial disturbances for lack of additional means of arbitration and conciliation which the Congress can easily and promptly supply. And all will agree that there must be no doubt as to the power of the Executive to make immediate and uninterrupted use of the railroads for the concentration of the military forces of the nation wherever they are needed and whenever they are needed.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">This is a <word altform="program">programme</word> of regulation, prevention, and administrative efficiency which argues its own case in the mere statement of it. With regard to one of its items, the increase in the efficiency of the Interstate Commerce Commission, the House of Representatives has already acted; its action needs only the concurrence of the Senate.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I would hesitate to recommend, and I dare say the Congress would hesitate to act upon the suggestion should I make it, that any man in any occupation should be obliged by law to continue in an employment which he desired to leave. To pass a law which forbade or prevented the individual workman to leave his work before receiving the approval of society in doing so would be to adopt a new principle into our jurisprudence which I take it for granted we are not prepared to introduce. But the proposal that the operation of the railways of the country shall not be stopped or interrupted by the concerted action of organized bodies of men until a public investigation shall have been instituted which shall make the whole question at issue plain for the judgment of the opinion of the nation is not to propose any such principle. It is based upon the very different principle that the concerted action of powerful bodies of men shall not be permitted to stop the industrial processes of the nation, at any rate before the nation shall have had an opportunity to acquaint itself with the merits of the case as between employee and employer, time to form its opinion upon an impartial statement of the merits, and opportunity to consider all practicable means of conciliation or arbitration. I can see nothing in that proposition but the justifiable safeguarding by society of the necessary processes of its very life. There is nothing arbitrary or unjust in it unless it be arbitrarily and unjustly done. It can and should be done with a full and scrupulous regard for the interests and liberties of all concerned as well as for the permanent interests of society itself.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Three matters of capital importance await the action of the Senate which have already been acted upon by the House of Representatives: the bill which seeks to extend greater freedom of combination to those engaged in promoting the foreign commerce of the country than is now thought by some to be legal under the terms of the laws against monopoly; the bill amending the present organic law of <place reg="Puerto Rico" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Porto Rico</place>; and the bill proposing a more thorough and systematic regulation of the expenditure of money in elections, commonly called the Corrupt Practices Act. I need not labor my advice that these measures be enacted into law. Their urgency lies in the manifest circumstances which render their adoption at this time not only opportune but necessary. Even delay would seriously jeopard the interests of the country and of the government.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Immediate passage of the bill to regulate the expenditure of money in elections may seem to be less necessary than the immediate enactment of the other measures to which I refer; because at least two years will elapse before another election in which federal offices are to be filled; but it would greatly relieve the public mind if this important matter were dealt with while the circumstances and the dangers to the public morals of the present method of obtaining and spending campaign funds stand clear under recent observation and the methods of expenditure can be frankly studied in the light of present experience; and a delay would have the further very serious disadvantage of postponing action until another election was at hand and some special object connected with it might be thought to be in the mind of those who urged it. Action can be taken now with facts for guidance and without suspicion of partisan purpose.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I shall not argue at length the desirability of giving a freer hand in the matter of combined and concerted effort to those who shall undertake the essential enterprise of building up our export trade. That enterprise will presently, will immediately assume, has indeed already assumed, a magnitude unprecedented in our experience. We have not the necessary instrumentalities for its prosecution; it is deemed to be doubtful whether they could be created upon an adequate scale under our present laws. We should clear away all legal obstacles and create a basis of undoubted law for it which will give freedom without permitting unregulated license. The thing must be done now, because the opportunity is here and may escape us if we hesitate or delay.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The argument for the proposed amendments of the organic law of <place reg="Puerto Rico" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Porto Rico</place> is brief and conclusive. The present laws governing <placeRef reg="Puerto Rico" link-pointer-type="place">the Island</placeRef> and regulating the rights and privileges of its people are not just. We have created expectations of extended privilege which we have not satisfied. There is uneasiness among the people of <placeRef reg="Puerto Rico" link-pointer-type="place">the Island</placeRef> and even a suspicious doubt with regard to our intentions concerning them which the adoption of the pending measure would happily remove. We do not doubt what we wish to do in any essential particular. We ought to do it at once.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">At the last session of the Congress a bill was passed by the Senate which provides for the promotion of vocational and industrial education which is of vital importance to the whole country because it concerns a matter, too long neglected, upon which the thorough industrial preparation of the country for the critical years of economic development immediately ahead of us in very large measure depends. May I not urge its early and favourable consideration by the House of Representatives and its early enactment into law? It contains plans which affect all interests and all parts of the country and I am sure that there is no legislation now pending before the Congress whose passage the country awaits with more thoughtful approval or greater impatience to see a great and admirable thing set in the way of being done.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">There are other matters already advanced to the stage of conference between the two Houses of which it is not necessary that I should speak. Some practicable basis of agreement concerning them will no doubt be found and action taken upon them.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Inasmuch as this is, Gentlemen, probably the last occasion I shall have to address the Sixty-fourth Congress, I hope that you will permit me to say with what genuine pleasure and satisfaction I have cooperated with you in the many measures of constructive policy with which you have enriched the legislative annals of the country. It has been a privilege to <word altform="labor">labour</word> in such company. I take the liberty of congratulating you upon the completion of a record of rare serviceableness and distinction.</p>

         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve"><render as="smallcap" rend="inherit">Gentlemen of the Senate</render>: On the <date value="1916-12-18">eighteenth of December last</date> I addressed an identic note to the governments of the nations now at war requesting them to state, more definitely than they had yet been stated by either group of belligerents, the terms upon which they would deem it possible to make peace. I spoke on behalf of humanity and of the rights of all neutral nations like our own, many of whose most vital interests the war puts in constant jeopardy. The Central Powers united in a reply which stated merely that they were ready to meet their antagonists in conference to discuss terms of peace. The Entente Powers have replied much more definitely and have stated, in general terms, indeed, but with sufficient definiteness to imply details, the arrangements, guarantees, and acts of reparation which they deem to be the indispensable conditions of a satisfactory settlement. We are that much nearer a definite discussion of the peace which shall end the present war. We are that much nearer the discussion of the international concert which must thereafter hold the world at peace. In every discussion of the peace that must end this war it is taken for granted that that peace must be followed by some definite concert of power which will make it virtually impossible that any such catastrophe should ever overwhelm us again. Every lover of mankind, every sane and thoughtful man must take that for granted.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I have sought this opportunity to address you because I thought that I owed it to you, as the council associated with me in the final determination of our international obligations, to disclose to you without reserve the thought and purpose that have been taking form in my mind in regard to the duty of our Government in the days to come when it will be necessary to lay afresh and upon a new plan the foundations of peace among the nations.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">It is inconceivable that the people of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> should play no part in that great enterprise. To take part in such a service will be the opportunity for which they have sought to prepare themselves by the very principles and purposes of their polity and the approved practices of their Government ever since the days when they set up a new nation in the high and <word altform="honorable">honourable</word> hope that it might in all that it was and did show mankind the way to liberty. They cannot in <word altform="honor">honour</word> withhold the service to which they are now about to be challenged. They do not wish to withhold it. But they owe it to themselves and to the other nations of the world to state the conditions under which they will feel free to render it.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">That service is nothing less than this, to add their authority and their power to the authority and force of other nations to guarantee peace and justice throughout the world. Such a settlement cannot now be long postponed. It is right that before it comes this Government should frankly formulate the conditions upon which it would feel justified in asking our people to approve its formal and solemn adherence to a League for Peace. I am here to attempt to state those conditions.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The present war must first be ended; but we owe it to <word altform="candor">candour</word> and to a just regard for the opinion of mankind to say that, so far as our participation in guarantees of future peace is concerned, it makes a great deal of difference in what way and upon what terms it is ended. The treaties and agreements which bring it to an end must embody terms which will create a peace that is worth guaranteeing and preserving, a peace that will win the approval of mankind, not merely a peace that will serve the several interests and immediate aims of the nations engaged. We shall have no voice in determining what those terms shall be, but we shall, I feel sure, have a voice in determining whether they shall be made lasting or not by the guarantees of a universal covenant; and our judgment upon what is fundamental and essential as a condition precedent to permanency should be spoken now, not afterwards when it may be too late.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">No covenant of cooperative peace that does not include the peoples of the New World can suffice to keep the future safe against war; and yet there is only one sort of peace that the peoples of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> could join in guaranteeing. The elements of that peace must be elements that engage the confidence and satisfy the principles of the American governments, elements consistent with their political faith and with the practical convictions which the peoples of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> have once for all embraced and undertaken to defend.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I do not mean to say that any American government would throw any obstacle in the way of any terms of peace the governments now at war might agree upon, or seek to upset them when made, whatever they might be. I only take it for granted that mere terms of peace between the belligerents will not satisfy even the belligerents themselves. Mere agreements may not make peace secure. It will be absolutely necessary that a force be created as a guarantor of the permanency of the settlement so much greater than the force of any nation now engaged or any alliance hitherto formed or projected that no nation, no probable combination of nations could face or withstand it. If the peace presently to be made is to endure, it must be a peace made secure by the organized major force of mankind.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The terms of the immediate peace agreed upon will determine whether it is a peace for which such a guarantee can be secured. The question upon which the whole future peace and policy of the world depends is this: Is the present war a struggle for a just and secure peace, or only for a new balance of power? If it be only a struggle for a new balance of power, who will guarantee, who can guarantee, the stable equilibrium of the new arrangement? Only a tranquil <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Europe</place> can be a stable <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Europe</place>. There must be, not a balance of power, but a community of power; not organized rivalries, but an organized common peace.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Fortunately we have received very explicit assurances on this point. The statesmen of both of the groups of nations now arrayed against one another have said, in terms that could not be misinterpreted, that it was no part of the purpose they had in mind to crush their antagonists. But the implications of these assurances may not be equally clear to all,—may not be the same on both sides of the water. I think it will be serviceable if I attempt to set forth what we understand them to be.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">They imply, first of all, that it must be a peace without victory. It is not pleasant to say this. I beg that I may be permitted to put my own interpretation upon it and that it may be understood that no other interpretation was in my thought. I am seeking only to face realities and to face them without soft concealments. Victory would mean peace forced upon the loser, a victor’s terms imposed upon the vanquished. It would be accepted in humiliation, under duress, at an intolerable sacrifice, and would leave a sting, a resentment, a bitter memory upon which terms of peace would rest, not permanently, but only as upon quicksand. Only a peace between equals can last. Only a peace the very principle of which is equality and a common participation in a common benefit. The right state of mind, the right feeling between nations, is as necessary for a lasting peace as is the just settlement of vexed questions of territory or of racial and national allegiance.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The equality of nations upon which peace must be founded if it is to last must be an equality of rights; the guarantees exchanged must neither recognize nor imply a difference between big nations and small, between those that are powerful and those that are weak. Right must be based upon the common strength, not upon the individual strength, of the nations upon whose concert peace will depend. Equality of territory or of resources there of course cannot be; nor any other sort of equality not gained in the ordinary peaceful and legitimate development of the peoples themselves. But no one asks or expects anything more than an equality of rights. Mankind is looking now for freedom of life, not for equipoises of power.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">And there is a deeper thing involved than even equality of right among organized nations. No peace can last, or ought to last, which does not recognize and accept the principle that governments derive all their just powers from the consent of the governed, and that no right anywhere exists to hand peoples about from sovereignty to sovereignty as if they were property. I take it for granted, for instance, if I may venture upon a single example, that statesmen everywhere are agreed that there should be a united, independent, and autonomous <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Poland</place>, and that henceforth inviolable security of life, of worship, and of industrial and social development should be guaranteed to all peoples who have lived hitherto under the power of governments devoted to a faith and purpose hostile to their own.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I speak of this, not because of any desire to exalt an abstract political principle which has always been held very dear by those who have sought to build up liberty in <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place>, but for the same reason that I have spoken of the other conditions of peace which seem to me clearly indispensable,—because I wish frankly to uncover realities. Any peace which does not recognize and accept this principle will inevitably be upset. It will not rest upon the affections or the convictions of mankind. The ferment of spirit of whole populations will fight subtly and constantly against it, and all the world will sympathize. The world can be at peace only if its life is stable, and there can be no stability where the will is in rebellion, where there is not tranquility of spirit and a sense of justice, of freedom, and of right.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">So far as practicable, moreover, every great people now struggling towards a full development of its resources and of its powers should be assured a direct outlet to the great highways of the sea. Where this cannot be done by the cession of territory, it can no doubt be done by the neutralization of direct rights of way under the general guarantee which will assure the peace itself. With a right comity of arrangement no nation need be shut away from free access to the open paths of the world’s commerce.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">And the paths of the sea must alike in law and in fact be free. The freedom of the seas is the <render as="italic" rend="inherit">sine qua non</render> of peace, equality, and cooperation. No doubt a somewhat radical reconsideration of many of the rules of international practice hitherto thought to be established may be necessary in order to make the seas indeed free and common in practically all circumstances for the use of mankind, but the motive for such changes is convincing and compelling. There can be no trust or intimacy between the peoples of the world without them. The free, constant, unthreatened intercourse of nations is an essential part of the process of peace and of development. It need not be difficult either to define or to secure the freedom of the seas if the governments of the world sincerely desire to come to an agreement concerning it.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">It is a problem closely connected with the limitation of naval armaments and the cooperation of the navies of the world in keeping the seas at once free and safe. And the question of limiting naval armaments opens the wider and perhaps more difficult question of the limitation of armies and of all <word altform="programs">programmes</word> of military preparation. Difficult and delicate as these questions are, they must be faced with the utmost <word altform="candor">candour</word> and decided in a spirit of real accommodation if peace is to come with healing in its wings, and come to stay. Peace cannot be had without concession and sacrifice. There can be no sense of safety and equality among the nations if great preponderating armaments are henceforth to continue here and there to be built up and maintained. The statesmen of the world must plan for peace and nations must adjust and accommodate their policy to it as they have planned for war and made ready for pitiless contest and rivalry. The question of armaments, whether on land or sea, is the most immediately and intensely practical question connected with the future fortunes of nations and of mankind.<space dim="vertical" extent="1" units="em"/></p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I have spoken upon these great matters without reserve and with the utmost explicitness because it has seemed to me to be necessary if the world’s yearning desire for peace was anywhere to find free voice and utterance. Perhaps I am the only person in high authority amongst all the peoples of the world who is at liberty to speak and hold nothing back. I am speaking as an individual, and yet I am speaking also, of course, as the responsible head of a great government, and I feel confident that I have said what the people of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> would wish me to say. May I not add that I hope and believe that I am in effect speaking for liberals and friends of humanity in every nation and of every <word altform="program">programme</word> of liberty? I would fain believe that I am speaking for the silent mass of mankind everywhere who have as yet had no place or opportunity to speak their real hearts out concerning the death and ruin they see to have come already upon the persons and the homes they hold most dear.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">And in holding out the expectation that the people and Government of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> will join the other civilized nations of the world in guaranteeing the permanence of peace upon such terms as I have named I speak with the greater boldness and confidence because it is clear to every man who can think that there is in this promise no breach in either our traditions or our policy as a nation, but a fulfilment, rather, of all that we have professed or striven for.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I am proposing, as it were, that the nations should with one accord adopt the doctrine of <person reg="James Monroe" link-pointer-type="person">President Monroe</person> as the doctrine of the world: that no nation should seek to extend its polity over any other nation or people, but that every people should be left free to determine its own polity, its own way of development, unhindered, unthreatened, unafraid, the little along with the great and powerful.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I am proposing that all nations henceforth avoid entangling alliances which would draw them into competitions of power, catch them in a net of intrigue and selfish rivalry, and disturb their own affairs with influences intruded from without. There is no entangling alliance in a concert of power. When all unite to act in the same sense and with the same purpose all act in the common interest and are free to live their own lives under a common protection.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I am proposing government by the consent of the governed; that freedom of the seas which in international conference after conference representatives of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> have urged with the eloquence of those who are the convinced disciples of liberty; and that moderation of armaments which makes of armies and navies a power for order merely, not an instrument of aggression or of selfish violence.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">These are American principles, American policies. We could stand for no others. And they are also the principles and policies of forward looking men and women everywhere, of every modern nation, of every enlightened community. They are the principles of mankind and must prevail.</p>

         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I very much regret to return this bill (H. R. 10384, “An act to regulate the immigration of aliens to, and the residence of aliens in, the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place>”) without my signature. In most of the provisions of the bill I should be very glad to concur, but I can not rid myself of the conviction that the literacy test constitutes a radical change in the policy of the Nation which is not justified in principle. It is not a test of character, of quality, or of personal fitness, but would operate in most cases merely as a penalty for lack of opportunity in the country from which the alien seeking admission came. The opportunity to gain an education is in many cases one of the chief opportunities sought by the immigrant in coming to the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place>, and our experience in the past has not been that the illiterate immigrant is as such an undesirable immigrant. Tests of quality and of purpose can not be objected to on principle, but tests of opportunity surely may be.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Moreover, even if this test might be equitably insisted on, one of the exceptions proposed to its application involves a provision which might lead to very delicate and hazardous diplomatic situations. The bill exempts from the operation of the literacy test “all aliens who shall prove <render as="italic" rend="inherit">to the satisfaction of the proper immigration officer or to the Secretary of Labor</render> that they are seeking admission to the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> to avoid religious persecution in the country of their last permanent residence, whether such persecution be evidenced by overt acts or by laws or governmental regulations that discriminate against the alien or the race to which he belongs because of his religious faith.” Such a provision, so applied and administered, would oblige the officer concerned in effect to pass judgment upon the laws and practices of a foreign Government and declare that they did or did not constitute religious persecution. This would, to say the least, be a most invidious function for any administrative officer of this Government to perform, and it is not only possible but probable that very serious questions of international justice and comity would arise between this Government and the Government or Governments thus officially condemned should its exercise be attempted. I dare say that these consequences were not in the minds of the proponents of this provision but the provision separately and in itself renders it unwise for me to give my assent to this legislation in its present form.</p>

         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The Imperial German Government on the <date value="1917-01-31">thirty-first of January</date> announced to this Government and to the governments of the other neutral nations that on and after the <date value="1917-02-01">first day of February</date>, the present month, it would adopt a policy with regard to the use of submarines against all shipping seeking to pass through certain designated areas of the high seas to which it is clearly my duty to call your attention.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Let me remind the Congress that on the <date value="1916-04-18">eighteenth of April last</date>, in view of the sinking on the <date value="1916-03-24">twenty-fourth of March</date> of the cross-channel passenger steamer <name type="ship">SUSSEX</name> by a German submarine, without summons or warning, and the consequent loss of the lives of several citizens of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> who were passengers aboard her, this Government addressed a note to the Imperial German Government in which it made the following declaration:<space dim="vertical" extent="1" units="em"/></p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">“If it is still the purpose of the Imperial Government to prosecute relentless and indiscriminate warfare against vessels of commerce by the use of submarines without regard to what the Government of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> must consider the sacred and indisputable rules of international law and the universally recognized dictates of humanity, the Government of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> is at last forced to the conclusion that there is but one course it can pursue. Unless the Imperial Government should now immediately declare and effect an abandonment of its present methods of submarine warfare against passenger and freight-carrying vessels, the Government of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> can have no choice but to sever diplomatic relations with the German Empire altogether.”<space dim="vertical" extent="1" units="em"/></p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">In reply to this declaration the Imperial German Government gave this Government the following assurance:<space dim="vertical" extent="1" units="em"/></p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">“The German Government is prepared to do its utmost to confine the operations of war for the rest of its duration to the fighting forces of the belligerents, thereby also insuring the freedom of the seas, a principle upon which the German Government believes, now as before, to be in agreement with the Government of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place>.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">“The German Government, guided by this idea, notifies the Government of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> that the German naval forces have received the following orders: In accordance with the general principles of visit and search and destruction of merchant vessels recognized by international law, such vessels, both within and without the area declared as naval war zone, shall not be sunk without warning and without saving human lives, unless these ships attempt to escape or offer resistance.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">“But,” it added, “neutrals can not expect that <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Germany</place>, forced to fight for her existence, shall, for the sake of neutral interest, restrict the use of an effective weapon if her enemy is permitted to continue to apply at will methods of warfare violating the rules of international law. Such a demand would be incompatible with the character of neutrality, and the German Government is convinced that the Government of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> does not think of making such a demand, knowing that the Government of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> has repeatedly declared that it is determined to restore the principle of the freedom of the seas, from whatever quarter it has been violated.”<space dim="vertical" extent="1" units="em"/></p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">To this the Government of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> replied on the <date value="1916-05-08">eighth of May</date>, accepting, of course, the assurances given, but adding,<space dim="vertical" extent="1" units="em"/></p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">“The Government of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> feels it necessary to state that it takes it for granted that the Imperial German Government does not intend to imply that the maintenance of its newly announced policy is in any way contingent upon the course or result of diplomatic negotiations between the Government of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> and any other belligerent Government, notwithstanding the fact that certain passages in the Imperial Government’s note of the 4th instant might appear to be susceptible of that construction. In order, however, to avoid any possible misunderstanding, the Government of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> notifies the Imperial Government that it can not for a moment entertain, much less discuss, a suggestion that respect by German naval authorities for the rights of citizens of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> upon the high seas should in any way or in the slightest degree be made contingent upon the conduct of any other Government affecting the rights of neutrals and noncombatants.

         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">To this note of the<date value="1916-05-08"> eighth of May</date> the Imperial German Government made no reply.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">On the <date value="1917-01-31">thirty-first of January</date>, the Wednesday of the present week, the <personRef reg="Johann Heinrich von Bernstorff" link-pointer-type="person">German Ambassador</personRef> handed to the <personRef refurl="x4004680" reg="Robert Lansing" link-pointer-type="person">Secretary of State</personRef>, along with a formal note, a memorandum which contains the following statement:<space dim="vertical" extent="1" units="em"/></p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">“The Imperial Government, therefore, does not doubt that the Government of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> will understand the situation thus forced upon <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Germany</place> by the Entente-Allies’ brutal methods of war and by their determination to destroy the Central Powers, and that the Government of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> will further realize that the now openly disclosed intentions of the Entente-Allies give back to <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Germany</place> the freedom of action which she reserved in her note addressed to the Government of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> on <date value="1916-05-04">May 4, 1916</date>.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">“Under these circumstances <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Germany</place> will meet the illegal measures of her enemies by forcibly preventing after <date value="1917-02-01">February 1, 1917</date>, in a zone around <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Great Britain</place>, <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">France</place>, <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Italy</place>, and in the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Eastern Mediterranean</place> all navigation, that of neutrals included, from and to <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">England</place> and from and to <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">France</place>, etc., etc. All ships met within the zone will be sunk.”<space dim="vertical" extent="1" units="em"/></p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I think that you will agree with me that, in view of this declaration, which suddenly and without prior intimation of any kind deliberately withdraws the solemn assurance given in the Imperial Government’s note of the <date value="1916-05-04">fourth of May, 1916</date>, this Government has no alternative consistent with the dignity and honour of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> but to take the course which, in its note of the <date value="1916-04-18">eighteenth of April, 1916</date>, it announced that it would take in the event that the German Government did not declare and effect an abandonment of the methods of submarine warfare which it was then employing and to which it now purposes again to resort.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I have, therefore, directed the <personRef refurl="x4004680" reg="Robert Lansing" link-pointer-type="person">Secretary of State</personRef> to announce to His Excellency the <personRef reg="Johann Heinrich von Bernstorff" link-pointer-type="person">German Ambassador</personRef> that all diplomatic relations between the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> and the German Empire are severed, and that the <personRef reg="James W. Gerard" link-pointer-type="person">American Ambassador</personRef> at <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Berlin</place> will immediately be withdrawn; and, in accordance with this decision, to hand to His Excellency his passports.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Notwithstanding this unexpected action of the German Government, this sudden and deeply deplorable renunciation of its assurances, given this Government at one of the most critical moments of tension in the relations of the two governments, I refuse to believe that it is the intention of the German authorities to do in fact what they have warned us they will feel at liberty to do. I cannot bring myself to believe that they will indeed pay no regard to the ancient friendship between their people and our own or to the solemn obligations which have been exchanged between them and destroy American ships and take the lives of American citizens in the wilful prosecution of the ruthless naval <word altform="program">programme</word> they have announced their intention to adopt. Only actual overt acts on their part can make me believe it even now.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">If this inveterate confidence on my part in the sobriety and prudent foresight of their purpose should unhappily prove unfounded; if American ships and American lives should in fact be sacrificed by their naval commanders in heedless contravention of the just and reasonable understandings of international law and the obvious dictates of humanity, I shall take the liberty of coming again before the Congress, to ask that authority be given me to use any means that may be necessary for the protection of our seamen and our people in the prosecution of their peaceful and legitimate errands on the high seas. I can do nothing less. I take it for granted that all neutral governments will take the same course.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">We do not desire any hostile conflict with the Imperial German Government. We are the sincere friends of the German people and earnestly desire to remain at peace with the Government which speaks for them. We shall not believe that they are hostile to us unless and until we are obliged to believe it; and we purpose nothing more than the reasonable defense of the undoubted rights of our people. We wish to serve no selfish ends. We seek merely to stand true alike in thought and in action to the immemorial principles of our people which I sought to express in my address to the Senate only two weeks ago,—seek merely to vindicate our right to liberty and justice and an unmolested life. These are the bases of peace, not war. God grant we may not be challenged to defend them by acts of wilful injustice on the part of the Government of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Germany</place>!</p>

         <p rend="noindent" xml:space="preserve"><render as="smallcap" rend="inherit">Gentlemen of the Congress</render>:</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I have again asked the privilege of addressing you because we are moving through critical times during which it seems to me to be my duty to keep in close touch with the Houses of Congress, so that neither counsel nor action shall run at cross purposes between us.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">On the <date value="1917-02-03">third of February</date> I <link refurl="4003431" link-pointer-type="RelatedDoc" rend="inherit"
                  xml:space="preserve">officially informed</link> you of the sudden and unexpected action of the Imperial German Government in declaring its intention to disregard the promises it had made to this Government in <date value="1916-04-99">April last</date> and undertake immediate submarine operations against all commerce, whether of belligerents or of neutrals, that should seek to approach <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Great Britain</place> and <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Ireland</place>, the Atlantic coasts of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Europe</place>, or the <word altform="harbors">harbours</word> of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">eastern Mediterranean</place>, and to conduct those operations without regard to the established restrictions of international practice, without regard to any considerations of humanity even which might interfere with their object. That policy was forthwith put into practice. It has now been in active execution for nearly four weeks.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Its practical results are not yet fully disclosed. The commerce of other neutral nations is suffering severely, but not, perhaps, very much more severely than it was already suffering before the <date value="1917-02-01">first of February</date>, when the new policy of the Imperial Government was put into operation. We have asked the cooperation of the other neutral governments to prevent these depredations, but so far none of them has thought it wise to join us in any common course of action. Our own commerce has suffered, is suffering, rather in apprehension than in fact, rather because so many of our ships are timidly keeping to their home ports than because American ships have been sunk.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Two American vessels have been sunk, the <name type="ship"><render as="italic" rend="inherit">Housatonic</render></name> and the <name type="ship"><render as="italic" rend="inherit">Lyman M. Law</render></name>. The case of the <name type="ship"><render as="italic" rend="inherit">Housatonic</render></name>, which was carrying food stuffs consigned to a <place reg="London, England" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">London</place> firm, was essentially like the case of the <name type="ship"><render as="italic" rend="inherit">Fry</render></name>, in which, it will be recalled, the German Government admitted its liability for damages, and the lives of the crew, as in the case of the <name type="ship"><render as="italic" rend="inherit">Fry</render></name>, were safeguarded with reasonable care. The case of the <name type="ship" key="Lyman M. Law"><render as="italic" rend="inherit">Law</render></name>, which was carrying lemon-box staves to <place reg="Palermo, Italy" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Palermo</place>, disclosed a ruthlessness of method which deserves grave condemnation, but was accompanied by no circumstances which might not have been expected at any time in connection with the use of the submarine against merchantmen as the German Government has used it.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">In sum, therefore, the situation we find ourselves in with regard to the actual conduct of the German submarine warfare against commerce and its effects upon our own ships and people is substantially the same that it was when I addressed you on the <date value="1917-02-03">third of February</date>, except for the tying up of our shipping in our own ports because of the unwillingness of our shipowners to risk their vessels at sea without insurance or adequate protection, and the very serious congestion of our commerce which has resulted, a congestion which is growing rapidly more and more serious every day. This in itself might presently accomplish, in effect, what the new German submarine orders were meant to accomplish, so far as we are concerned. We can only say, therefore, that the overt act which I have ventured to hope the German commanders would in fact avoid has not occurred.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">But, while this is happily true, it must be admitted that there have been certain additional indications and expressions of purpose on the part of the German press and the German authorities which have increased rather than lessened the impression that, if our ships and our people are spared, it will be because of fortunate circumstances or because the commanders of the German submarines which they may happen to encounter exercise an unexpected discretion and restraint rather than because of the instructions under which those commanders are acting. It would be foolish to deny that the situation is fraught with the gravest possibilities and dangers. No thoughtful man can fail to see that the necessity for definite action may come at any time, if we are in fact, and not in word merely, to defend our elementary rights as a neutral nation, It would be most imprudent to be unprepared.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I cannot in such circumstances be unmindful of the fact that the expiration of the term of the present Congress is immediately at hand, by constitutional limitation; and that it would in all likelihood require an unusual length of time to assemble and organize the Congress which is to succeed it. I feel that I ought, in view of that fact, to obtain from you full and immediate assurance of the authority which I may need at any moment to exercise. No doubt I already possess that authority without special warrant of law, by the plain implication of my constitutional duties and powers; but I prefer, in the present circumstances, not to act upon general implication. I wish to feel that the authority and the power of the Congress are behind me in whatever it may become necessary for me to do. We are jointly the servants of the people and must act together and in their spirit, so far as we can divine and interpret it.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">No one doubts what it is our duty to do. We must defend our commerce and the lives of our people in the midst of the present trying circumstances, with discretion but with clear and steadfast purpose. Only the method and the extent remain to be chosen, upon the occasion, if occasion should indeed arise. Since it has unhappily proved impossible to safeguard our neutral rights by diplomatic means against the unwarranted infringements they are suffering at the hands of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Germany</place>, there may be no recourse but to <render as="italic" rend="inherit">armed</render> neutrality, which we shall know how to maintain and for which there is abundant American precedent.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">It is devoutly to be hoped that it will not be necessary to put armed force anywhere into action. The American people do not desire it, and our desire is not different from theirs. I am sure that they will understand the spirit in which I am now acting, the purpose I hold nearest my heart and would wish to exhibit in everything I do. I am anxious that the people of the nations at war also should understand and not mistrust us. I hope that I need give no further proofs and assurances than I have already given throughout nearly three years of anxious patience that I am the friend of peace and mean to preserve it for <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> so long as I am able. I am not now proposing or contemplating war or any steps that need lead to it. I merely request that you will accord me by your own vote and definite bestowal the means and the authority to safeguard in practice the right of a great people who are at peace and who are desirous of exercising none but the rights of peace to follow the pursuits of peace in quietness and good will,—rights recognized time out of mind by all the civilized nations of the world. No course of my choosing or of theirs will lead to war. War can come only by the wilful acts and aggressions of others.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">You will understand why I can make no definite proposals or forecasts of action now and must ask for your supporting authority in the most general terms. The form in which action may become necessary cannot yet be foreseen. I believe that the people will be willing to trust me to act with restraint, with prudence, and in the true spirit of amity and good faith that they have themselves displayed throughout these trying months; and it is in that belief that I request that you will authorize me to supply our merchant ships with defensive arms, should that become necessary, and with the means of using them, and to employ any other instrumentalities or methods that may be necessary and adequate to protect our ships and our people in their legitimate and peaceful pursuits on the seas. I request also that you will grant me at the same time, along with the powers I ask, a sufficient credit to enable me to provide adequate means of protection where they are lacking, including adequate insurance against the present war risks.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I have spoken of our commerce and of the legitimate errands of our people on the seas, but you will not be misled as to my main thought, the thought that lies beneath these phrases and gives them dignity and weight. It is not of material interests merely that we are thinking. It is, rather, of fundamental human rights, chief of all the right of life itself. I am thinking, not only of the rights of Americans to go and come about their proper business by way of the sea, but also of something much deeper, much more fundamental than that. I am thinking of those rights of humanity without which there is no civilization. My theme is of those great principles of compassion and of protection which mankind has sought to throw about human lives, the lives of non-combatants, the lives of men who are peacefully at work keeping the industrial processes of the world quick and vital, the lives of women and children and of those who supply the <word altform="labor">labour</word> which ministers to their sustenance. We are speaking of no selfish material rights but of rights which our hearts support and whose foundation is that righteous passion for justice upon which all law, all structures alike of family, of state, and of mankind must rest, as upon the ultimate base of our existence and our liberty. I cannot imagine any man with American principles at his heart hesitating to defend these things.</p>

         <p rend="noindent" xml:space="preserve"><render as="smallcap" rend="inherit">My Fellow Citizens</render>:</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The four years which have elapsed since last I stood in this place have been crowded with counsel and action of the most vital interest and consequence. Perhaps no equal period in our history has been so fruitful of important reforms in our economic and industrial life or so full of significant changes in the spirit and purpose of our political action. We have sought very thoughtfully to set our house in order, correct the grosser errors and abuses of our industrial life, liberate and quicken the processes of our national genius and energy, and lift our politics to a broader view of the people’s essential interests. It is a record of singular variety and singular distinction. But I shall not attempt to review it. It speaks for itself and will be of increasing influence as the years go by. This is not the time for retrospect. It is time, rather, to speak our thoughts and purposes concerning the present and the immediate future.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Although we have centered counsel and action with such unusual concentration and success upon the great problems of domestic legislation to which we addressed ourselves four years ago, other matters have more and more forced themselves upon our attention, matters lying outside our own life as a nation and over which we had no control, but which, despite our wish to keep free of them, have drawn us more and more irresistibly into their own current and influence.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">It has been impossible to avoid them. They have affected the life of the whole world. They have shaken men everywhere with a passion and an apprehension they never knew before. It has been hard to preserve calm counsel while the thought of our own people swayed this way and that under their influence. We are a composite and cosmopolitan people. We are of the blood of all the nations that are at war. The currents of our thoughts as well as the currents of our trade run quick at all seasons back and forth between us and them. The war inevitably set its mark from the first alike upon our minds, our industries, our commerce, our politics, and our social action. To be indifferent to it or independent of it was out of the question.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">And yet all the while we have been conscious that we were not part of it. In that consciousness, despite many divisions, we have drawn closer together. We have been deeply wronged upon the seas, but we have not wished to wrong or injure in return; have retained throughout the consciousness of standing in some sort apart, intent upon an interest that transcended the immediate issues of the war itself. As some of the injuries done us have become intolerable we have still been clear that we wished nothing for ourselves that we were not ready to demand for all mankind,—fair dealing, justice, the freedom to live and be at ease against organized wrong.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">It is in this spirit and with this thought that we have grown more and more aware, more and more certain that the part we wished to play was the part of those who mean to vindicate and fortify peace. We have been obliged to arm ourselves to make good our claim to a certain minimum of right and of freedom of action. We stand firm in armed neutrality since it seems that in no other way we can demonstrate what it is we insist upon and cannot forego. We may even be drawn on, by circumstances, not by our own purpose or desire, to a more active assertion of our rights as we see them and a more immediate association with the great struggle itself. But nothing will alter our thought or our purpose. They are too clear to be obscured. They are too deeply rooted in the principles of our national life to be altered. We desire neither conquest nor advantage. We wish nothing that can be had only at the cost of another people. We have always professed unselfish purpose and we covet the opportunity to prove that our professions are sincere.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">There are many things still to do at home, to clarify our own politics and give new vitality to the industrial processes of our own life, and we shall do them as time and opportunity serve; but we realize that the greatest things that remain to be done must be done with the whole world for stage and in coöperation with the wide and universal forces of mankind, and we are making our spirits ready for those things. They will follow in the immediate wake of the war itself and will set civilization up again. We are provincials no longer. The tragical events of the thirty months of vital turmoil through which we have just passed have made us citizens of the world. There can be no turning back. Our own fortunes as a nation are involved, whether we would have it so or not.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">And yet we are not the less Americans on that account. We shall be the more American if we but remain true to the principles in which we have been bred. They are not the principles of a province or of a single continent. We have known and boasted all along that they were the principles of a liberated mankind. These, therefore, are the things we shall stand for, whether in war or in peace:</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">That all nations are equally interested in the peace of the world and in the political stability of free peoples, and equally responsible for their maintenance;</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">That the essential principle of peace is the actual equality of nations in all matters of right or privilege;</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">That peace cannot securely or justly rest upon an armed balance of power;</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">That governments derive all their just powers from the consent of the governed and that no other powers should be supported by the common thought, purpose, or power of the family of nations.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">That the seas should be equally free and safe for the use of all peoples, under rules set up by common agreement and consent, and that, so far as practicable, they should be accessible to all upon equal terms;</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">That national armaments should be limited to the necessities of national order and domestic safety;</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">That the community of interest and of power upon which peace must henceforth depend imposes upon each nation the duty of seeing to it that all influences proceeding from its own citizens meant to encourage or assist revolution in other states should be sternly and effectually suppressed and prevented.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I need not argue these principles to you, my fellow countrymen: they are your own, part and parcel of your own thinking and your own motive in affairs. They spring up native amongst us. Upon this as a platform of purpose and of action we can stand together.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">And it is imperative that we should stand together. We are being forged into a new unity amidst the fires that now blaze throughout the world. In their ardent heat we shall, in God’s providence, let us hope, be purged of faction and division, purified of the errant humors of party and of private interest, and shall stand forth in the days to come with a new dignity of national pride and spirit. Let each man see to it that the dedication is in his own heart, the high purpose of the Nation in his own mind, ruler of his own will and desire.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I stand here and have taken the high and solemn oath to which you have been audience because the people of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> have chosen me for this august delegation of power and have by their gracious judgment named me their leader in affairs. I know now what the task means. I realize to the full the responsibility which it involves. I pray God I may be given the wisdom and the prudence to do my duty in the true spirit of this great people. I am their servant and can succeed only as they sustain and guide me by their confidence and their counsel. The thing I shall count upon, the thing without which neither counsel nor action will avail, is the unity of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place>,—an <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> united in feeling, in purpose, and in its vision of duty, of opportunity, and of service. We are to beware of all men who would turn the tasks and the necessities of the Nation to their own private profit or use them for the building up of private power; beware that no faction or disloyal intrigue break the harmony or embarrass the spirit of our people; beware that our Government be kept pure and incorrupt in all its parts. United alike in the conception of our duty and in the high resolve to perform it in the face of all men, let us dedicate ourselves to the great task to which we must now set our hand. For myself I beg your tolerance, your countenance, and your united aid. The shadows that now lie dark upon our path will soon be dispelled and we shall walk with the light all about us if we be but true to ourselves,—to ourselves as we have wished to be known in the counsels of the world and in the thought of all those who love liberty and justice and the right exalted.</p>

                <render as="smallcap" rend="inherit">Gentlemen Of The Congress:</render>
            </p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I have called the Congress into extraordinary session because there are serious, very
                serious, choices of policy to be made, and made immediately, which it was neither right nor
                constitutionally permissible that I should assume the responsibility of making.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">On the <date value="1917-02-03">third of February last</date> I officially laid before you
                the extraordinary announcement of the Imperial German Government that on and after the <date value="1917-02-01">first day of Feburary</date> it was its purpose to put aside all restraints of
                law or of humanity and use its submarines to sink every vessel that sought to approach either the ports
                of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Great Britain</place> and <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Ireland</place> or the western coasts of
                <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Europe</place> or any of the ports controlled by the enemies of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Germany</place> with the
                    <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Mediterranean</place>. That had seemed to be the object of the German submarine warfare
                earlier in the war, but since April of last year the Imperial Government had somewhat restrained the
                commanders of its undersea craft in conformity with its promise then given to us that passenger boats
                should not be sunk and that due warning would be given to all other vessels which its submarines might
                seek to destroy, when no resistance was offered or escape attempted, and care taken that their crews
                were given at least a fair chance to save their lives in their open boats. The precautions taken were
                    <word altform="meager">meagre</word> and haphazard enough, as was proved in distressing instance
                after instance in the progress of the cruel and unmanly business, but a certain degree of restraint was
                observed. The new policy has swept every restriction aside. Vessels of every kind, whatever their flag,
                their character, their cargo, their destination, their errand, have been ruthlessly sent to the bottom
                without warning and without thought of help or mercy for those on board, the vessels of friendly
                neutrals along with those of belligerents. Even hospital ships and ships carrying relief to the sorely
                bereaved and stricken people of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Belgium</place>, though the latter were provided with safe
                conduct through the proscribed areas by the German Government itself and were distinguished by
                unmistakable marks of identity, have been sunk with the same reckless lack of compassion or of
                principle.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I was for a little while unable to believe that such things would in fact be done by any
                government that had hitherto subscribed to the humane practices of civilized nations. International law
                had its origin in the attempt to set up some law which would be respected and observed upon the seas,
                where no nation had right of dominion and where lay the free highways of the world. By painful stage
                after stage has that law been built up, with <word altform="meager">meagre</word> enough results,
                indeed, after all was accomplished that could be accomplished, but always with a clear view, at least,
                of what the heart and conscience of mankind demanded. This minimum of right the German Government has
                swept aside under the plea of retaliation and necessity and because it had no weapons which it could use
                at sea except those which it is impossible to employ as it is employing them without throwing to the
                winds all scruples of humanity or of respect for the understandings that were supposed to underlie the
                intercourse of the world. I am not now thinking of the loss of property involved, immense and serious as
                that is, but only of the wanton and wholesale destruction of the lives of non-combatants, men, women,
                and children, engaged in pursuits which have always, even in the darkest periods of modern history, been
                deemed innocent and legitimate. Property can be paid for; the lives of peaceful and innocent people
                cannot be. The present German submarine warfare against commerce is a warfare against mankind.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">It is a war against all nations. American ships have been sunk, American lives taken, in
                ways which it has stirred us very deeply to learn of, but the ships and people of other neutral and
                friendly nations have been sunk and overwhelmed in the waters in the same way. There has been no
                discrimination. The challenge is to all mankind. Each nation must decide for itself how it will meet it.
                The choice we make for ourselves must be made with a moderation of counsel and a temperateness of
                judment befitting our character and our motives as a nation. We must put excited feeling away. Our
                motive will not be revenge or the victorious assertion of the physical might of the nation, but only the
                vindication of right, of human right, of which we are only a single champion.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">When I addressed the Congress on the <date value="1917-02-26">twenty-sixth of February
                last</date> I thought that it would suffice to assert our netural rights with arms, our right to use the
                seas against unlawful itnerference, our right to keep our people safe against unlawful violence. But
                armed neutrality, it now appears, is impracticable. Because submarines are in effect outlaws when used
                as the German submarines have been used against merchant shipping, it is impossible to defend ships
                against their attacks as the law of nations has assumed that <sic corr="merchantmen">merchantment</sic>
                would defend themselves against privateers or cruisers, visible craft giving chase upon the open sea. It
                is common prudence in such circumstances, grim necessity indeed, to endeavour to destroy them before
                they have shown their intention. They must be dealt with upon sight, if dealt with at all. The German
                Government denies the right to neutrals to use arms at all within the areas of the sea which it has
                proscribed, even in the defense of rights which no modern publicist has ever before questioned their
                right to defend. The intimation is conveyed that the armed guards which we have placed on our merchant
                ships will be treated as beyond the pale of law and subject to be dealt with as pirates would be. Armed
                neutrality is ineffectual enough at best; in such circumstances and in the face of such pretensions it
                is worse than ineffectual: it is likely only to produce what it was meant to prevent; it is practically
                certain to draw us into the war without either the rights or the effectiveness of belligerents. There is
                one choice we cannot make, we are incapable of making: we will not choose the path of submission and
                suffer the most sacred rights of our nation and our people to be ignored or violated. The wrongs against
                which we now array ourselves are no common wrongs; they cut to the very roots of human life.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">With a profound sense of the solemn and even tragical character of the step I am taking and
                of the very grave responsibilities which it involves, but in unhesitating obedience to what I deem my
                constitutional duty, I advise that the Congress declare the recent course of the Imperial German
                Government to be in fact nothing less than war against the government and people of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United
                    States</place>; that it formally accept the status of belligerent which has thus been thrust upon
                it; and that it ake immediate steps not only to put the country in a more thorough state of defense but
                also to exert all its power and emply all its resources to bring the Government of the German Empire to
                terms and end the war.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">What this will involve is clear. It will involve the utmost practicable cooperation in
                counsel and action with the governments now at war with <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Germany</place>, and, as incident to
                that, the extension to those governments of the most liberal financial credits, in order that our
                resources may so far as possible be added to theirs. It will involve the organization and mobilization
                of all the material resources of the country to supply the materials of war and serve the incidental
                needs of the nation in the most abundant and yet the most economical and efficient way possible. It will
                involve the immediate full equipment of the navy in all respects but particularly in supplying it with
                the best means of dealing with the enemy’s submarines. It will involve the immediate addition to the
                armed forces of the United States already provided for by law in case of war at least five hundred
                thousand men, who should, in my opinion, be chosen upon the principle of universal liability to service,
                and also the authorization of subsequent additional increments of equal force so soon as they may be
                needed and can be handled in training. It will involve also, of course, the granting of adequate credits
                to the Government, sustained, I hope, so far as they can equitably be sustained by the present
                generation, by well conceived taxation.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I say sustained so far as may be equitable by taxation because it seems to me that it would
                be most unwise to base the credits which will now be necessary entirely on money borrowed. It is our
                duty, I most respectfully urge, to protect our people so far as we may against the very serious
                hardships and evils which would be likely to arise out of the inflation which would be produced by vast
                loans.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">In carrying out the measures by which these things are to be accomplished we should keep
                constantly in mind the wisdom of interfering as little as possible in our own preparation and in the
                equipment of our own military forces with the duty,—for it will be a very practical duty,—of supplying
                the nations already at war with <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Germany</place> with the materials which they can obtain only
                from us or by our assistance. They are in the field and we should help them in every way to be effective
                there.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I shall take the liberty of suggesting, through the several executive departments of the
                Government, for the consideration of our committees, measures for the accomplishment of the several
                objects I have mentioned. I hope that it will be your pleasure to deal with them as having been framed
                after very careful thought by the branch of the Government upon which the responsibility of conducting
                the war and safeguarding the nation will most directly fall.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">While we do these things, these deeply momentous things, let us be very clear, and make
                very clear to all the world what our motives and our objectives are. My own thought has not been driven
                from its habitual and normal course by the unhappy events of the last two months, and I do not believe
                that the thought of the nation has been altered or clouded by them. I have exactly the same things in
                mind now that I had in mind when I addressed the Senate on the <date value="1917-01-22">twenty-second of
                    January last</date>; the same things that I had in mind when I addressed the Congress on the <date value="1917-02-03">third of February</date> and on the <date value="1917-02-26">twenty-sixth of
                    February</date>. Our object now, as then, is to vindicate the principles of peace and justice in the
                life of the world as against selfish and autocratic power and to set up amongst the really free and
                self-governed peoples of the world such a concert of purpose and of action as will henceforth ensure the
                observance of those principles. Neutrality is no longer feasible or desirable where the peace of the
                world is involved and the freedom of its peoples, and the menace to that peace and freedom lies in the
                existence of autocratic governments backed by organized force which is controlled wholly by their will,
                not by the will of their people. We have seen the last of neutrality in such circumstances. We are at
                the beginning of an age in which it will be insisted that the same standards of conduct and of
                responsibility for wrong done shall be observed among nations and their governments that are observed
                among the individual citizens of civilized states.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">We have no quarrel with the German people. We have no feeling towards them but one of
                sympathy and friendship. It was not upon their impulse that their government acted in tendering this
                war. It was not with their previous knowledge or approval. It was a war determined upon as wars used to
                be determined upon in the old, unhappy days when peoples were nowhere consulted by their rulers and wars
                were provoked and waged in the interest of dynasties or of little groups of ambitious men who were
                accustomed to use their fellow men as pawns and tools. Self-governed nations do not fill their neighbour
                states with spies or set the course of intrigue to bring about some critical posture of affairs which
                will give them an opportunity to strike and make conquest. Such designs can be successfully worked out
                only under cover and where no one has the right to ask questions. Cunningly contrived plans of deception
                or aggression, carried, it may be, from generation to generation, can be worked out and kept from the
                light only within the privacy of courts or behind the carefully guarded confidences of a narrow and
                privileged class. They are happily impossible where public opinion commands and insists upon full
                information concerning all the nation’s affairs.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">A steadfast concert for peace can never be maintained except by a partnership of democratic
                nations. No autocratic government could be trusted to keep faith within it or observe its covenants. It
                must be a league of honor, a partnership of opinion. Intrigue would eat its vitals away; the plottings
                of inner circles who could plan what they would and render account to no one would be a corruption
                seated at its very heart. Only free peoples can hold their purpose and their <word altform="honor">honour</word> steady to a common end and prefer the interests of mankind to any narrow interest of
                their own.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Does not every American feel that assurance has been added to our hope for the future peace
                of the world by the wonderful and heartening things that have been happening within the last few weeks
                in <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Russia</place>? <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Russia</place> was known by those who knew it best to have been always
                in fact democratic at heart, in all the vital habits of her thought, in all the intimate relationships
                of her people that spoke their natural instinct, their habitual attitude towards life. The autocracy
                that crowned the summit of her political structure, long as it had stood and terrible as was the reality
                of its power, was not in fact Russian in origin, character, or purpose; and now it has been shaken off
                and the great, generous Russian people have been added in all their naive majesty and might to the
                forces that are fighting for freedom in the world, for justice, and for peace. Here is a fit partner for
                a League of <word altform="Honor">Honour</word>.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">One of the things that has served to convince us that the Prussian autocracy was not and
                could never be our friend is that from the very outset of the present war it has filled our unsuspecting
                communities and even our offices of government with spies and set criminal intrigues everywhere a foot
                against our national unity of counsel, our peace within and without, our industries and our commerce.
                Indeed it is now evident that its spies were here even before the war began; and it is unhappily not a
                matter of conjecture but a fact proved in our courts of justice that the intrigues which have more than
                once come perilously near to disturbing the peace and dislocating the industires of the country have
                been carried on at the instigation, with the support, and even under the personal direction of official
                agents of the Imperial Government accredited to the Government of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place>. Even
                in checking these things and trying to extirpate them we have sought to put the most generous
                interpretation possible upon them because we knew that their source lay, not in any hostile feeling or
                purpose of the German people towards us (who were, no doubt as ignorant of them as we ourselves were),
                but only in the selfish designs of a Government that did what it pleased and told its people nothing.
                But they have played their part in serving to convince us at last that that Government entertains no
                real friendship for us and means to act against our peace and security at its convenience. That it means
                to stir up enemies against us at our very doors the intercepted note of the German Minister at <place reg="Mexico City, Mexico" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Mexico City</place> is eloquent evidence.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">We are accepting this challenge of hostile purpose because we know that in such a
                government, following such methods, we can never have a friend; and that in the presence of its
                organized power, always lying in wait to accomplish we know not what purpose, there can be no assured
                security for the democratic governments of the world. We are now about to accept gauge of battle with
                this natural foe to liberty and shall, if necessary, spend the whole force of the nation to check and
                nullify its pretensions and its power. We are glad, now that we see the facts with no veil of false
                pretence about them, to fight thus for the ultimate peace of the world and for the liberation of its
                peoples, the German peoples included: for the rights of nations great and small and the privilege of men
                everywhere to choose their way of life and of obedience. The world must be made safe for democracy. Its
                peace must be planted upon the tested foundations of political liberty. We have no selfish ends to
                serve. We desire no conquest, no dominion. We seek no indemnities for ourselves, no material
                compensation for the sacrifices we shall freely make. We are but one of the champions of the rights of
                mankind. We shall be satisfied when those rights have been made as secure as the faith and the freedom
                of nations can make them.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Just because we fight without rancour and without selfish object, seeking nothing for
                ourselves but what we shall wish to share with all free peoples, we shall, I feel confident, conduct our
                operations as belligerents without passion and ourselves observe with proud punctilio the principles of
                right and fair play we profess to be fighting for.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I have said nothing of the governments allied with the Imperial Government of
                    <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Germany</place> because they have not made war upon us or challenged us to defend our right
                and our <word altform="honor">honour</word>. The Austro-Hungarian Government has, indeed, avowed its
                unqualified endorsement and acceptance of the reckless and lawless submarine warfare adopted now without
                disguise by the Imperial German Government, and it has therefore not been possible for this Government
                to receive <person link-pointer-type="person">Count Tarnowski</person>, the Ambassador recently accredited to this Government by
                the Imperial and Royal Government of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Austria-Hungary</place>; but that Government has not
                actually engaged in warfare against citizens of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> on the seas, and I take
                the liberty, for the present at least, of postponing a discussion of our relations with the authorities
                at <place reg="Vienna, Austria" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Vienna</place>. We enter this war only where we are clearly forced into
                it because there are no other means of defending our rights.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">It will be all the easier for us to conduct ourselves as belligerents in a high spirit of
                right and fairness because we act without animus, not in enmity towards a people or with the desire to
                bring any injury or disadvantage upon them, but only in armed opposition to an irresponsible government
                which has thrown aside all considerations of humanity and of right and is running amuck. We are, let me
                say again, the sincere friends of the German people, and shall desire nothing so much as the early
                re-establishment of intimate relations of mutual advantage between us,—however hard it may be for them,
                for the time being, to believe that this is spoken from our hearts. We have borne with their present
                government through all these bitter months because of that friendship,—exercising a patience and
                forbearance which would otherwise have been impossible. We shall, happily, still have an opportunity to
                prove that friendship in our daily attitude and actions towards the millions of men and women of German
                birth and native sympathy who live amongst us and share our life, and we shall be proud to prove it
                towards all who are in fact loyal to their neighbours and to the Government in the hour of test. They
                are, most of them, as true and loyal Americans as if they had never known any other fealty or
                allegiance. They will be prompt to stand with us in rebuking and restraining the few who may be of a
                different mind and purpose. If there should be disloyalty, it will be dealt with with a firm hand of
                stern repression; but, if it lifts its head at all, it will lift it only here and there and without
                countenance except from a lawless and malignant few.<space dim="vertical" extent="1" units="em"/></p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">It is a distressing and oppressive duty, Gentlemen of Congress, which I have performed in
                thus addressing you. There are, it may be, many months of fiery trial and sacrifice ahead of us. It is a
                fearful thing to lead this great and peaceful people into war, into the most terrible and disastrous of
                all wars, civilization itself seeming to be in the balance. But the right is more precious than peace,
                and we shall fight for the things which we have always carried nearest our hearts,—for democracy, for
                the right of those who submit to authority to have a voice in their own governments, for the rights and
                liberties of small nations, for a universal dominion of right by such a concert of free peoples as shall
                bring peace and safety to all nations and make the world itself at last free. To such a task we can
                dedicate our lives and our fortunes, everything that we are and everything that we have, with the pride
                of those who know that the day has come when <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> is privileged to spend her blood and
                her might for the principles that gave her birth and happiness and the peace which she has treasured.
                God helping her, she can do no other.</p>

         <p rend="noindent" xml:space="preserve"><render as="smallcap" rend="inherit">My Fellow-Countrymen</render>:</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The entrance of our own beloved country into the grim and terrible war for democracy and human rights which has shaken the world creates so many problems of national life and action which call for immediate consideration and settlement that I hope you will permit me to address to you a few words of earnest counsel and appeal with regard to them.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">We are rapidly putting our navy upon an effective war footing and are about to create and equip a great army, but these are the simplest parts of the great task to which we have addressed ourselves. There is not a single selfish element, so far as I can see, in the cause we are fighting for. We are fighting for what we believe and wish to be the rights of mankind and for the future peace and security of the world. To do this great thing worthily and successfully we must devote ourselves to the service without regard to profit or material advantage and with an energy and intelligence that will rise to the level of the enterprise itself. We must realize to the full how great the task is and how many things, how many kinds and elements of capacity and service and self-sacrifice, it involves.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">These, then, are the things we must do, and do well, besides fighting,—the things without which mere fighting would be fruitless:</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">We must supply abundant food for ourselves and for our armies and our seamen not only, but also for a large part of the nations with whom we have now made common cause, in whose support and by whose sides we shall be fighting;</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">We must supply ships by the hundreds out of our shipyards to carry to the other side of the sea, submarines or no submarines, what will every day be needed there, and abundant materials out of our fields and our mines and our factories with which not only to clothe and equip our own forces on land and sea but also to clothe and support our people for whom the gallant fellows under arms can no longer work, to help clothe and equip the armies with which we are cooperating in <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Europe</place>, and to keep the looms and manufactories there in raw material; coal to keep the fires going in ships at sea and in the furnaces of hundreds of factories across the sea; steel out of which to make arms and ammunition both here and there; rails for worn-out railways back of the fighting fronts; locomotives and rolling stock to take the place of those every day going to pieces; mules, horses, cattle for labor and for military service; everything with which the people of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">England</place> and <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">France</place> and <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Italy</place> and <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Russia</place> have usually supplied themselves but can not now afford the men, the materials, or the machinery to make.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">It is evident to every thinking man that our industries, on the farms, in the shipyards, in the mines, in the factories, must be made more prolific and more efficient than ever and that they must be more economically managed and better adapted to the particular requirements of our task than they have been; and what I want to say is that the men and the women who devote their thought and their energy to these things will be serving the country and conducting the fight for peace and freedom just as truly and just as effectively as the men on the battlefield or in the trenches. The industrial forces of the country, men and women alike, will be a great national, a great international, Service Army,—a notable and honored host engaged in the service of the nation and the world, the efficient friends and saviors of free men everywhere. Thousands, nay hundreds of thousands, of men otherwise liable to military service will of right and of necessity be excused from that service and assigned to the fundamental, sustaining work of the fields and factories and mines, and they will be as much part of the great patriotic forces of the nation as the men under fire.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I take the liberty, therefore, of addressing this word to the farmers of the country and to all who work on the farms: The supreme need of our own nation and of the nations with which we are cooperating is an abundance of supplies, and especially of food stuffs. The importance of an adequate food supply, especially for the present year, is superlative. Without abundant food, alike for the armies and the peoples now at war, the whole great enterprise upon which we have embarked will break down and fail. The world’s food reserves are low. Not only during the present emergency but for some time after peace shall have come both our own people and a large proportion of the people of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Europe</place> must rely upon the harvests in <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place>. Upon the farmers of this country, therefore, in large measure, rests the fate of the war and the fate of the nations. May the nation not count upon them to omit no step that will increase the production of their land or that will bring about the most effectual cooperation in the sale and distribution of their products? The time is short. It is of the most imperative importance that everything possible be done and done immediately to make sure of large harvests. I call upon young men and old alike and upon the able-bodied boys of the land to accept and act upon this duty—to turn in hosts to the farms and make certain that no pains and no labor is lacking in this great matter.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I particularly appeal to the farmers of the South to plant abundant food stuffs as well as cotton. They can show their patriotism in no better or more convincing way than by resisting the great temptation of the present price of cotton and helping, helping upon a great scale, to feed the nation and the peoples everywhere who are fighting for their liberties and for our own. The variety of their crops will be the visible measure of their comprehension of their national duty.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The Government of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> and the governments of the several States stand ready to cooperate. They will do everything possible to assist farmers in securing an adequate supply of seed, an adequate force of laborers when they are most needed, at harvest time, and the means of expediting shipments of fertilizers and farm machinery, as well as of the crops themselves when harvested. The course of trade shall be as unhampered as it is possible to make it and there shall be no unwarranted manipulation of the nation’s food supply by those who handle it on its way to the consumer. This is our opportunity to demonstrate the efficiency of a great Democracy and we shall not fall short of it!</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">This let me say to the middlemen of every sort, whether they are handling our food stuffs or our raw materials of manufacture or the products of our mills and factories: The eyes of the country will be especially upon you. This is your opportunity for signal service, efficient and disinterested. The country expects you, as it expects all others, to forego unusual profits, to organize and expedite shipments of supplies of every kind, but especially of food, with an eye to the service you are rendering and in the spirit of those who enlist in the ranks, for their people, not for themselves. I shall confidently expect you to deserve and win the confidence of people of every sort and station.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">To the men who run the railways of the country, whether they be managers or operative employees, let me say that the railways are the arteries of the nation’s life and that upon them rests the immense responsibility of seeing to it that those arteries suffer no obstruction of any kind, no inefficiency or slackened power. To the merchant let me suggest the motto, “Small profits and quick service;” and to the shipbuilder the thought that the life of the war depends upon him. The food and the war supplies must be carried across the seas no matter how many ships are sent to the bottom. The places of those that go down must be supplied and supplied at once. To the miner let me say that he stands where the farmer does; the work of the world waits on him. If he slackens or fails, armies and statesmen are helpless. He also is enlisted in the great Service Army. The manufacturer does not need to be told, I hope, that the nation looks to him to speed and perfect every process; and I want only to remind his employees that their service is absolutely indispensable and is counted on by every man who loves the country and its liberties.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Let me suggest, also, that everyone who creates or cultivates a garden helps, and helps greatly, to solve the problem of the feeding of the nations; and that every housewife who practices strict economy puts herself in the ranks of those who serve the nation. This is the time for <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> to correct her unpardonable fault of wastefulness and extravagance. Let every man and every woman assume the duty of careful, provident use and expenditure as a public duty, as a dictate of patriotism which no one can now expect ever to be excused or forgiven for ignoring.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">In the hope that this statement of the needs of the nation and of the world in this hour of supreme crisis may stimulate those to whom it comes and remind all who need reminder of the solemn duties of a time such as the world has never seen before, I beg that all editors and publishers everywhere will give as prominent publication and as wide circulation as possible to this appeal. I venture to suggest, also, to all advertising agencies that they would perhaps render a very substantial and timely service to the country if they would give it widespread repetition. And I hope that clergymen will not think the theme of it an unworthy or inappropriate subject of comment and homily from their pulpits.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The supreme test of the nation has come. We must all speak, act, and serve together!</p>

         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve"><render as="italic" rend="inherit">My Fellow Citizens:</render> We meet to celebrate Flag Day because this flag which we <word altform="honor">honour</word> and under which we serve is the emblem of our unity, our power, our thought and purpose as a nation. It has no other character than that which we give it from generation to generation. The choices are ours. It floats in majestic silence above the hosts that execute those choices, whether in peace or in war. And yet, though silent, it speaks to us,—speaks to us of the past, of the men and women who went before us and of the records they wrote upon it. We celebrate the day of its birth; and from its birth until now it has witnessed a great history, has floated on high the symbol of great events, of a great plan of life worked out by a great people. We are about to carry it into battle, to lift it where it will draw the fire of our enemies. We are about to bid thousands, hundreds of thousands, it may be millions, of our men, the young, the strong, the capable men of the nation, to go forth and die beneath it on fields of blood far away,—for what? For some unaccustomed thing? For something for which it has never sought the fire before? American armies were never before sent across the seas. Why are they sent now? For some new purpose, for which this great flag has never been carried before, or for some old, familiar, heroic purpose for which it has seen men, its own men, die on every battlefield upon which Americans have borne arms since the Revolution?</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">These are questions which must be answered. We are Americans. We in our turn serve <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place>, and can serve her with no private purpose. We must use her flag as she has always used it. We are accountable at the bar of history and must plead in utter frankness what purpose it is we seek to serve.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">It is plain enough how we were forced into the war. The extraordinary insults and aggressions of the Imperial German Government left us no self-respecting choice but to take up arms in defense of our rights as a free people and of our <word altform="honor">honour</word> as a sovereign government. The military masters of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Germany</place> denied us the right to be neutral. They filled our unsuspecting communities with vicious spies and conspirators and sought to corrupt the opinion of our people in their own behalf. When they found that they could not do that, their agents diligently spread sedition amongst us and sought to draw our own citizens from their allegiance,—and some of those agents were men connected with the official Embassy of the German Government itself here in our own capital. They sought by violence to destroy our industries and arrest our commerce. They tried to incite <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Mexico</place> to take up arms against us and to draw <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Japan</place> into a hostile alliance with her,—and that, not by indirection, but by direct suggestion from the Foreign Office in <place reg="Berlin, Germany" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Berlin</place>. They impudently denied us the use of the high seas and repeatedly executed their threat that they would send to their death any of our people who ventured to approach the coasts of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Europe</place>. And many of our own people were corrupted. Men began to look upon their own <word altform="neighbors">neighbours</word> with suspicion and to wonder in their hot resentment and surprise whether there was any community in which hostile intrigue did not lurk. What great nation in such circumstances would not have taken up arms? Much as we had desired peace, it was denied us, and not of our own choice. This flag under which we serve would have been <word altform="dishonored">dishonoured</word> had we withheld our hand.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">But that is only part of the story. We know now as clearly as we knew before we were ourselves engaged that we are not the enemies of the German people and that they are not our enemies. They did not originate or desire this hideous war or wish that we should be drawn into it; and we are vaguely conscious that we are fighting their cause, as they will some day see it, as well as our own. They are themselves in the grip of the same sinister power that has now at last stretched its ugly talons out and drawn blood from us. The whole world is at war because the whole world is in the grip of that power and is trying out the great battle which shall determine whether it is to be brought under its mastery or fling itself free.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The war was begun by the military masters of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Germany</place>, who proved to be also the masters of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Austria-Hungary</place>. These men have never regarded nations as peoples, men, women, and children of like blood and frame as themselves, for whom governments existed and in whom governments had their life. They have regarded them merely as serviceable organizations which they could by force or intrigue bend or corrupt to their own purpose. They have regarded the smaller states, in particular, and the peoples who could be overwhelmed by force, as their natural tools and instruments of domination. Their purpose has long been avowed. The statesmen of other nations, to whom that purpose was incredible, paid little attention; regarded what German professors expounded in their classrooms and German writers set forth to the world as the goal of German policy as rather the dream of minds detached from practical affairs, as preposterous private conceptions of German destiny, than as the actual plans of responsible rulers; but the rulers of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Germany</place> themselves knew all the while what concrete plans, what well advanced intrigues lay back of what the professors and the writers were saying, and were glad to go forward unmolested, filling the thrones of Balkan states with German princes, putting German officers at the service of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Turkey</place> to drill her armies and make interest with her government, developing plans of sedition and rebellion in <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">India</place> and <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Egypt</place>, setting their fires in <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Persia</place>. The demands made by <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Austria</place> upon <place reg="Serbia" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Servia</place> were a mere single step in a plan which compassed <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Europe</place> and <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Asia</place>, from <place reg="Berlin, Germany" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Berlin</place> to <place reg="Baghdad, Turkey (Iraq)" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Bagdad</place>. They hoped those demands might not arouse <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Europe</place>, but they meant to press them whether they did or not, for they thought themselves ready for the final issue of arms.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Their plan was to throw a broad belt of German military power and political control across the very <word altform="center">centre</word> of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Europe</place> and beyond the Mediterranean into the heart of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Asia</place>; and <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Austria-Hungary</place> was to be as much their tool and pawn as <place reg="Serbia" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Servia</place> or <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Bulgaria</place> or <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Turkey</place> or the ponderous states of the East. <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Austria-Hungary</place>, indeed, was to become part of the central German Empire, absorbed and dominated by the same forces and influences that had originally cemented the German states themselves. The dream had its heart at <place reg="Berlin, Germany" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Berlin</place>. It could have had a heart nowhere else! It rejected the idea of solidarity of race entirely. The choice of peoples played no part in it at all. It contemplated binding together racial and political units which could be kept together only by force,—Czechs, Magyars, Croats, Serbs, <word altform="Romanians">Roumanians</word>, Turks, Armenians,—the proud states of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Bohemia</place> and <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Hungary</place>, the stout little commonwealths of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Balkans</place>, the indomitable Turks, the subtile peoples of the East. These peoples did not wish to be united. They ardently desired to direct their own affairs, would be satisfied only by undisputed independence. They could be kept quiet only by the presence or the constant threat of armed men. They would live under a common power only by sheer compulsion and await the day of revolution. But the German military statesmen had reckoned with all that and were ready to deal with it in their own way.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">And they have actually carried the greater part of that amazing plan into execution! Look how things stand. <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Austria</place> is at their mercy. It has acted, not upon its own initiative or upon the choice of its own people, but at <place reg="Berlin, Germany" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Berlin’s</place> dictation ever since the war began. Its people now desire peace, but cannot have it until leave is granted from <place reg="Berlin, Germany" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Berlin</place>. The so-called Central Powers are in fact but a single Power. <place reg="Serbia" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Servia</place> is at its mercy, should its hands be but for a moment freed. <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Bulgaria</place> has consented to its will, and <place reg="Romania" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Roumania</place> is overrun. The Turkish armies, which Germans trained, are serving <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Germany</place>, certainly not themselves, and the guns of German warships lying in the <word altform="harbor">harbour</word> at <place reg="Constantinople, Turkey" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Constantinople</place> remind Turkish statesmen every day that they have no choice but to take their orders from <place reg="Berlin, Germany" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Berlin</place>. From <place reg="Hamburg, Germany" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Hamburg</place> to the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Persian Gulf</place> the net is spread.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Is it not easy to understand the eagerness for peace that has been manifested from <place reg="Berlin, Germany" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Berlin</place> ever since the snare was set and sprung? Peace, peace, peace has been the talk of her Foreign Office for now a year and more; not peace upon her own initiative, but upon the initiative of the nations over which she now deems herself to hold the advantage. A little of the talk has been public, but most of it has been private. Through all sorts of channels it has come to me, and in all sorts of guises, but never with the terms disclosed which the German Government would be willing to accept. That government has other valuable pawns in its hands besides those I have mentioned. It still holds a valuable part of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">France</place>, though with slowly relaxing grasp, and practically the whole of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Belgium</place>. Its armies press close upon <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Russia</place> and overrun <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Poland</place> at their will. It cannot go further; it dare not go back. It wishes to close its bargain before it is too late and it has little left to offer for the pound of flesh it will demand.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The military masters under whom <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Germany</place> is bleeding see very clearly to what point Fate has brought them. If they fall back or are forced back an inch, their power both abroad and at home will fall to pieces like a house of cards. It is their power at home they are thinking about now more than their power abroad. It is that power which is trembling under their very feet; and deep fear has entered their hearts. They have but one chance to perpetuate their military power or even their controlling political influence. If they can secure peace now with the immense advantages still in their hands which they have up to this point apparently gained, they will have justified themselves before the German people: they will have gained by force what they promised to gain by it: an immense expansion of German power, an immense enlargement of German industrial and commercial opportunities. Their prestige will be secure, and with their prestige their political power. If they fail, their people will thrust them aside; a government accountable to the people themselves will be set up in <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Germany</place> as it has been in <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">England</place>, in the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place>, in <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">France</place>, and in all the great countries of the modern time except <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Germany</place>. If they succeed they are safe and <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Germany</place> and the world are undone; if they fail <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Germany</place> is saved and the world will be at peace. If they succeed, <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> will fall within the menace. We and all the rest of the world must remain armed, as they will remain, and must make ready for the next step in their aggression; if they fail, the world may unite for peace and <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Germany</place> may be of the union.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Do you not now understand the new intrigue, the intrigue for peace, and why the masters of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Germany</place> do not hestitate to use any agency that promises to effect their purpose, the deceit of the nations? Their present particular aim is to deceive all those who throughout the world stand for the rights of peoples and the self-government of nations; for they see what immense strength the forces of justice and of liberalism are gathering out of this war. They are employing liberals in their enterprise. They are using men, in <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Germany</place> and without, as their spokesmen whom they have hitherto despised and oppressed, using them for their own destruction,—socialists, the leaders of <word altform="labor">labour</word>, the thinkers they have hitherto sought to silence. Let them once succeed and these men, now their tools, will be ground to powder beneath the weight of the great military empire they will have set up; the revolutionists in <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Russia</place> will be cut off from all succour or cooperation in western <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Europe</place> and a counter revolution fostered and supported; <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Germany</place> herself will lose her chance of freedom; and all <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Europe</place> will arm for the next, the final struggle.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The sinister intrigue is being no less actively conducted in this country than in <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Russia</place> and in every country in <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Europe</place> to which the agents and dupes of the Imperial German Government can get access. That government has many spokesmen here, in places high and low. They have learned discretion. They keep within the law. It is opinion they utter now, not sedition. They proclaim the liberal purposes of their masters; declare this a foreign war which can touch <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> with no danger to either her lands or her institutions; set <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">England</place> at the <word altform="center">centre</word> of the stage and talk of her ambition to assert economic dominion throughout the world; appeal to our ancient tradition of isolation in the politics of the nations; and seek to undermine the government with false professions of loyalty to its principles.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">But they will make no headway. The false betray themselves always in every accent. It is only friends and partisans of the German Government whom we have already identified who utter these thinly disguised disloyalties. The facts are patent to all the world, and nowhere are they more plainly seen than in the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place>, where we are accustomed to deal with facts and not with sophistries; and the great fact that stands out above all the rest is that this is a Peoples’ War, a war for freedom and justice and self-government amongst all the nations of the world, a war to make the world safe for the peoples who live upon it and have made it their own, the German people themselves included; and that with us rests the choice to break through all these hypocrisies and patent cheats and masks of brute force and help set the world free, or else stand aside and let it be dominated a long age through by sheer weight of arms and the arbitrary choices of self-constituted masters, by the nation which can maintain the biggest armies and the most irresistible armaments,—a power to which the world has afforded no parallel and in the face of which political freedom must wither and perish.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">For us there is but one choice. We have made it. Woe be to the man or group of men that seeks to stand in our way in this day of high resolution when every principle we hold dearest is to be vindicated and made secure for the salvation of the nations. We are ready to plead at the bar of history, and our flag shall wear a new <word altform="luster">lustre</word>. Once more we shall make good with our lives and fortunes the great faith to which we were born, and a new glory shall shine in the face of our people.</p>

         <p rend="noindent" xml:space="preserve"><render as="smallcap" rend="inherit"><person refurl="x4003539" reg="Henry T. Mayo" link-pointer-type="person">Admiral Mayo</person> and Gentlemen</render>:</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I have not come here with malice prepense to make a speech, but I have come here to have a look at you and to say some things that perhaps may be intimately said and, even though the company is large, said in confidence. Of course, the whole circumstance of the modern time is extraordinary and I feel that just because the circumstances are extraordinary there is an opportunity to see to it that the action is extraordinary. One of the deprivations which any man in authority experiences is that he cannot come into constant and intimate touch with the men with whom he is associated and necessarily associated in action.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Most of my life has been spent in contact with young men and, though I would not admit it to them at the time, I have learned a great deal more from them than they ever learned from me. I have had most of my thinking stimulated by questions being put to me which I could not answer, and I have had a great many of my preconceived conceptions absolutely destroyed by men who had not given half the study to the subject that I myself had given. The fact of the matter is that almost every profession is pushed forward by the men who do not belong to it and know nothing about it, because they ask the ignorant questions which it would not occur to the professional man to ask at all; he supposes that they have been answered, whereas it may be that most of them had not been answered at all. The naiveté of the point of view, the whole approach of the mind that has had nothing to do with the question, creates an entirely different atmosphere. There is many a question asked you about the Navy which seems to you so simple-minded when you hear it that you laugh, and then you find you cannot answer it. It never occurred to you that anybody could ask that question before, it is so simple.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Now, the point that is constantly in my mind, gentlemen, is this: This is an unprecedented war and, therefore, it is a war in one sense for amateurs. Nobody ever before conducted a war like this and therefore nobody can pretend to be a professional in a war like this. Here are two great navies, not to speak of the others associated with us, our own and the British, outnumbering by a very great margin the navy to which we are opposed, and yet casting about for a way in which to use our superiority and our strength, because of the novelty of the instruments used, because of the unprecedented character of the war, because, as I said just now, nobody ever before fought a war like this, in the way that this is being fought at sea—or on land either for that matter. The experienced soldier,—experienced in previous wars,—is a back number so far as his experience is concerned; not so far as his intelligence is concerned. His experience does not count, because he never fought a war as this is being fought, and therefore he is an amateur along with the rest of us. Now, somebody has got to think this war out. Somebody has got to think out the way not only to fight the submarine, but to do something different from what we are doing.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">We are hunting hornets all over the farm and letting the nest alone. None of us knows how to go to the nest and crush it, and yet I despair of hunting for hornets all over the sea when I know where the nest is and know that the nest is breeding hornets as fast as I can find them. I am willing for my part, and I know you are willing because I know the stuff you are made of,—I am willing to sacrifice half the navy <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Great Britain</place> and we together have to crush that nest, because if we crush it, the war is won. I have come here to say that I do not care where it comes from, I do not care whether it comes from the youngest officer or the oldest, but I want the officers of this Navy to have the distinction of saying how this war is going to be won. The <personRef refurl="x4005046" reg="Josephus Daniels" link-pointer-type="person">Secretary of the Navy</personRef> and I have just been talking over plans for putting the planning machinery of the Navy at the disposal of the brains of the Navy and not stopping to ask what rank that brains has, because, as I have said before and want to repeat, so far as experience in this kind of war is concerned we are all of the same rank. I am not saying that I do not expect the Admirals to tell us what to do, but I am saying that I want the youngest and most modest youngster in the service to tell us what we ought to do if he knows what it is. I am willing to make any sacrifice for that. I mean any sacrifice of time or anything else. I am ready to put myself at the disposal of any officer in the Navy who thinks he knows how to run this war. I will not undertake to tell you whether he does or not, because I know I can not, but I will undertake to put him in communication with those who can find out whether his idea will work or not. I have the authority to do that and I will do it with the greatest pleasure.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The idea that is in my mind all the time is that we are comrades in this thing. I was talking the other day with some commercial men about certain questions which seemed to affect their material interest in this war, and I said, “I can’t imagine a man thinking about those things. If we don’t win this war, your material interest won’t make any difference. The prices you are charging are a matter of indifference with regard to the results of this war because if we don’t win it, you will not have the chance to charge any prices, and I can’t imagine a man in the present circumstances of the world sitting down and thinking about his own interest or the interest of anybody personally associated with him as compared with the interest of the world.” I cannot say it too often to any audience, we are fighting a thing, not a people. The most extraordinary circumstance of modern history is the way in which the German people have been subordinated to the German system of authority, and how they have accepted their thinking from authority as well as their action from authority. Now, we do not intend to let that method of action and of thinking be imposed upon the rest of the world. Knowing as some of us do the fine quality of the German people, we are sorry that it was ever imposed upon them and we are anxious to see that they have their glad emancipation, but we intend to see to it that no other people suffers a like limitation and subordination. We went into this war because this system touched us. These people that stopped at nothing paid no attention to our rights, destroyed the lives of our people, invaded the dignity of our sovereignty, tried to make interest against us in the minds of our own people, and the thing was intolerable. We had to strike, but thank God we were striking not only for ourselves but for everybody else that loves liberty under God’s heaven, and therefore we are in some peculiar sense the trustees of liberty.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I wish that I could think and had the brains to think in the terms of marine warfare, because I would feel then that I was figuring out the future history of the political freedom of mankind. I do not see how any man can look at the flag of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> and fail having his mind crowded with reminiscences of the number of unselfish men, seeking no object of their own, the advantage of no dynasty, the advantage of no group of privileged people, but the advantage of his fellow-men, who have died under the folds of that beautiful emblem. I wonder if men who do die under it realize the distinction they have. There is no comparison between dying in your bed in quiet times for nothing in particular and dying under that emblem of the might and destiny and pride of a great free people. There is distinction in the privilege and I for my part am sorry to play so peaceful a part in the business as I myself am obliged to play, and I conceive it a privilege to come and look at you men who have the other thing to do and ask you to come and tell me or tell anybody you want to tell how this thing can be better done; and we will thank God that we have got men of originative brains among us.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">We have got to throw tradition to the wind. As I have said, gentlemen, I take it for granted that nothing that I say here will be repeated and therefore I am going to say this: Every time we have suggested anything to the British Admiralty the reply has come back that virtually amounted to this, that it had never been done that way, and I felt like saying, “Well, nothing was ever done so systematically as nothing is being done now. Therefore, I should like to see something unusual happen, something that was never done before; and inasmuch as the things that are being done to you were never done before, don’t you think it is worth while to try something that was never done before against those who are doing them to you.” There is no other to win, and the whole principle of this war is the kind of thing that ought to hearten and stimulate <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place>. <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> has always boasted that she could find men to do anything. She is the prize amateur nation of the world. <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Germany</place> is the prize professional nation of the world. Now, when it comes to doing new things and doing them well, I will back the amateur against the professional every time, because the professional does it out of the book and the amateur does it with his eyes open upon a new world and with a new set of circumstances. He knows so little about it that he is fool enough to try the right thing. The men that do not know the danger are the rashest men, and I have several times ventured to make this suggestion to the men about me in both arms of the service: Please leave out of your vocabulary altogether the word “prudent.” Do not stop to think about what is prudent for a moment. Do the thing that is audacious to the utmost point of risk and daring, because that is exactly the thing that the other side does not understand, and you will win by the audacity of method when you cannot win by circumspection and prudence. I think that there are willing ears to hear this in the American Navy and the American Army because that is the kind of folks we are. We get tired of the old ways and covet the new ones.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">So, gentlemen, besides coming down here to give you my personal greeting and to say how absolutely I rely on you and believe in you, I have come down here to say also that I depend on you, depend on you for brains as well as training and courage and discipline. You are doing your job admirably, the job that you have been taught to do; now let us do something that we were never taught to do and do it just as well as we are doing the older and more habitual things, and do not let anybody ever put one thought of discouragement into your minds. I do not know what is the matter with the newspapers of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place>! I suppose they have to vary the tune from time to time just to relieve their minds, but every now and then a wave of the most absurd discouragement and pessismism goes through the country and we hear nothing except of the unusual advantages and equipment and sagacity and preparation and all the other wonderful things of the German Army and Navy. My comment is always the very familiar comment, “Rats!” They are working under infinite disadvantages. They not only have no more brains than we have, but they have a different and less serviceable kind of brains than we have, if we will use the brains we have got. I am not discouraged for a moment, particularly because we have not even begun and, without saying anything in disparagement of those with whom we are associated in the war, I do expect things to begin when we begin. If they do not, American history will have changed its course; the American Army and Navy will have changed their character. There will have to come a new tradition into a service which does not do new and audacious and successful things.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I am very much obliged to you for having given me this opportunity to see you and I hope you will also give me the pleasure of shaking hands with each one of you. If you ever want me again for anything in particular—because I am a busy man and can not come for anything that is not particular—send for me and I will come.</p>

         <H3>REPLY OF THE UNITED STATES TO THE COMMUNICATION OF <personRef refurl="x4000652" reg="Pope Benedict XV" link-pointer-type="person">THE POPE</personRef> TO THE BELLIGERENT GOVERNMENTS.</H3>

         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">In acknowledgement of the communication of <personRef refurl="x4000652" reg="Pope Benedict XV" link-pointer-type="person">Your Holiness</personRef> to the belligerent peoples, dated <date value="1917-08-01">August 1, 1917</date>, <personRef refurl="x4000418" reg="Woodrow Wilson" link-pointer-type="person">the President of the United States</personRef> requests me to transmit the following reply:</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Every heart that has not been blinded and hardened by this terrible <abbr expan="World War I">war</abbr> must be touched by this moving appeal of <personRef refurl="x4000652" reg="Pope Benedict XV" link-pointer-type="person">His Holiness the Pope</personRef>, must feel the dignity and force of the humane and generous motives which prompted it, and must fervently wish that we might take the path of peace he so persuasively points out. But it would be folly to take it if it does not in fact lead to the goal he proposes. Our response must be based upon the stern facts and upon nothing else. It is not a mere cessation of arms he desires; it is a stable and enduring peace. This agony must not be gone through with again, and it must be a matter of very sober judgment what will insure us against it.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve"><personRef refurl="x4000652" reg="Pope Benedict XV" link-pointer-type="person">His Holiness</personRef> in substance proposes that we return to the status quo ante bellum, and that then there be a general condonation, disarmament, and a concert of nations based upon an acceptance of the principle of arbitration; that by a similar concert freedom of the seas be established; and that the territorial claims of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">France</place> and <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Italy</place>, the perplexing problems of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Balkan States</place>, and the restitution of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Poland</place> be left to such conciliatory adjustments as may be possible in the new temper of such a peace, due regard being paid to the aspirations of the peoples whose political fortunes and affiliations will be involved.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">It is manifest that no part of this program can be successfully carried out unless the restitution of the status quo ante furnishes a firm and satisfactory basis for it. The object of this war is to deliver the free peoples of the world from the menace and the actual power of a vast military establishment controlled by an irresponsible government which, having secretly planned to dominate the world, proceeded to carry the plan out without regard either to the sacred obligations of treaty or the long-established practices and long-cherished principles of international action and honor; which chose its own time for the war; delivered its blow fiercely and suddenly; stopped at no barrier either of law or of mercy; swept a whole continent within the tide of blood—not the blood of soldiers only, but the blood of innocent women and children also and of the helpless poor; and now stands balked but not defeated, the enemy of four-fifths of the world. This power is not the German people. It is the ruthless master of the German people. It is no business of ours how that great people came under its control or submitted with temporary zest to the domination of its purpose; but it is our business to see to it that the history of the rest of the world is no longer left to its handling.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">To deal with such a power by way of peace upon the plan proposed by <personRef refurl="x4000652" reg="Pope Benedict XV" link-pointer-type="person">His Holiness the Pope</personRef> would, so far as we can see, involve a recuperation of its strength and a renewal of its policy; would make it necessary to create a permanent hostile combination of nations against the German people who are its instruments; and would result in abandoning the newborn <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Russia</place> to the intrigue, the manifold subtle interference, and the certain counter-revolution which would be attempted by all the malign influences to which the German Government has of late accustomed the world. Can peace be based upon a restitution of its power or upon any word of honor it could pledge in a treaty of settlement and accomodation?</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Reponsible statesmen must now everywhere see, if they never saw before, that no peace can rest securely upon political or economic restrictions meant to benefit some nations and cripple or embarrass others, upon vindictive action of any sort, or any kind of revenge or deliberate injury. The American people have suffered intolerable wrongs at the hands of the Imperial German Government, but they desire no reprisal upon the German people who have themselves suffered all things in this war which they did not choose. They believe that peace should rest upon the rights of peoples, not the rights of Governments—the rights of peoples great or small, weak or powerful—their equal right to freedom and security and self-government and to a participation upon fair terms in the economic opportunities of the world, the German people of course included if they will accept equality and not seek domination.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The test, therefore, of every plan of peace is this: Is it based upon the faith of all the people involved or merely upon the word of an ambitious and intriguing government on the one hand and of a group of free peoples on the other? This is a test which goes to the root of the matter; and it is a test which must be applied.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The purposes of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> in this war are known to the whole world, to every people to whom the truth has been permitted to come. They do not need to be stated again. We seek no material advantage of any kind. We believe that the intolerable wrongs done in this war by the furious and brutal power of the Imperial German Government ought to be repaired, but not at the expense of the sovereignty of any people—rather a vindication of the sovereignty both of those that are weak and of those that are strong. Punitive damages, the dismemberment of empires, the establishment of selfish and exclusive economic leagues, we deem inexpedient and in the end worse than futile, no proper basis for peace of any kind, least of all for enduring peace. That must be based upon justice and fairness and the common rights of mankind.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">We can not take the word of the present rulers of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Germany</place> as a guaranty of anything that is to endure, unless explicitly supported by such conclusive evidence of the will and purpose of the German people themselves as the other peoples of the world would be justified in accepting. Without such guaranties treaties of settlement, agreements for disarmament, covenants to set up arbitration in the place of force, territorial adjustments, reconstitutions of small nations, if made with the German Government, no man, no nation could now depend on. We must await some new evidence of the purposes of the great peoples of the central powers. God grant that it may be given soon and in a way to restore the confidence of all peoples everywhere in the faith of nations and the possibility of a covenanted peace.</p>

         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I esteem it a great privilege and a real honor to be thus admitted to your public counsels. When your executive committee paid me the compliment of inviting me here I gladly accepted the invitation because it seems to me that this, above all other times in our history, is the time for common counsel, for the drawing together not only of the energies but of the minds of the Nation. I thought that it was a welcome opportunity for disclosing to you some of the thoughts that have been gathering in my mind during these last momentous months.</p>
         <p rend="center" xml:space="preserve"><space dim="vertical" extent="1" units="em"/>CRITICAL TIME IN HISTORY.<space dim="vertical" extent="1" units="em"/></p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I am introduced to you as the President of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place>, and yet I would be pleased if you would put the thought of the office into the background and regard me as one of your fellow citizens who has come here to speak, not the words of authority, but the words of counsel; the words which men should speak to one another who wish to be frank in a moment more critical perhaps than the history of the world has ever yet known; a moment when it is every man’s duty to forget himself, to forget his own interests, to fill himself with the nobility of a great national and world conception, and act upon a new platform elevated above the ordinary affairs of life and lifted to where men have views of the long destiny of mankind.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I think that in order to realize just what this moment of counsel is it is very desirable that we should remind ourselves just how this <abbr expan="World War I">war</abbr> came about and just what it is for. You can explain most wars very simply, but the explanation of this is not so simple. Its roots run deep into all the obscure soils of history, and in my view this is the last decisive issue between the old principle of power and the new principle of freedom.</p>
         <p rend="center" xml:space="preserve"><space dim="vertical" extent="1" units="em"/>WAR STARTED BY <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">GERMANY</place>.<space dim="vertical" extent="1" units="em"/></p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The war was started by <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Germany</place>. Her authorities deny that they started it, but I am willing to let the statement I have just made await the verdict of history. And the thing that needs to be explained is why <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Germany</place> started the war. Remember what the position of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Germany</place> in the world was—as enviable a position as any nation has ever occupied. The whole world stood at admiration of her wonderful intellectual and material achievements. All the intellectual men of the world went to school to her. As a university man I have been surrounded by men trained in <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Germany</place>, men who had resorted to <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Germany</place> because nowhere else could they get such thorough and searching training, particularly in the principles of science and the principles that underlie modern material achievement. Her men of science had made her industries perhaps the most competent industries of the world, and the label “Made in <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Germany</place>” was a guarantee of good workmanship and of sound material. She had access to all the markets of the world, and every other nation who traded in those markets feared <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Germany</place> because of her effective and almost irresistible competition. She had a “place in the sun.”</p>
         <p rend="center" xml:space="preserve"><space dim="vertical" extent="1" units="em"/>GERMANY’S INDUSTRIAL GROWTH.<space dim="vertical" extent="1" units="em"/></p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Why was she not satisfied? What more did she want? There was nothing in the world of peace that she did not already have and have in abundance. We boast of the extraordinary pace of American advancement. We show with pride the statistics of the increase of our industries and of the population of our cities. Well, those statistics did not match the recent statistics of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Germany</place>. Her old cities took on youth and grew faster than any American cities ever grew. Her old industries opened their eyes and saw a new world and went out for its conquest. And yet the authorities of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Germany</place> were not satisfied.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">You have one part of the answer to the question why she was not satisfied in her methods of competition. There is no important industry in <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Germany</place> upon which the Government has not laid its hands, to direct it and, when necessity arose, control it; and you have only to ask any man whom you meet who is familiar with the conditions that prevailed before the war in the matter of national competition to find out the methods of competition which the German manufacturers and exporters used under the patronage and support of the Government of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Germany</place>. You will find that they were the same sorts of competition that we have tried to prevent by law within our own borders. If they could not sell their goods cheaper than we could sell ours at a profit to themselves they could get a subsidy from the Government which made it possible to sell them cheaper anyhow, and the conditions of competition were thus controlled in large measure by the German Government itself.</p>
         <p rend="center" xml:space="preserve"><space dim="vertical" extent="1" units="em"/><place reg="Berlin, Germany" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">BERLIN</place>-<place reg="Baghdad, Turkey (Iraq)" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">BAGDAD</place> RAILWAY.<space dim="vertical" extent="1" units="em"/></p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">But that did not satisfy the German Government. All the while there was lying behind its thought and in its dreams of the future a political control which would enable it in the long run to dominate the labor and the industry of the world. They were not content with success by superior achievement; they wanted success by authority. I suppose very few of you have thought much about the <place reg="Berlin, Germany" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Berlin</place>-to-<place reg="Baghdad, Turkey (Iraq)" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Bagdad</place> Railway. The <place reg="Berlin, Germany" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Berlin</place>-<place reg="Baghdad, Turkey (Iraq)" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Bagdad</place> Railway was constructed in order to run the threat of force down the flank of the industrial undertakings of half a dozen other countries; so that when German competition came in it would not be resisted too far, because there was always the possibility of getting German armies into the heart of that country quicker than any other armies could be got there.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Look at the map of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Europe</place> now! <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Germany</place> in thrusting upon us again and again the discussion of peace talks,—about what? Talks about <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Belgium</place>; talks about northern <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">France</place>; talks about <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Alsace-Lorraine</place>. Well those are deeply interesting subjects to us and to them, but they are not the heart of the matter. Take the map and look at it. <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Germany</place> has absolute control of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Austria-Hungary</place>, practical control of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Balkan States</place>, control of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Turkey</place>, control of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Asia Minor</place>. I saw a map in which the whole thing was printed in appropriate black the other day, and the black stretched all the way from <place reg="Hamburg, Germany" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Hamburg</place> to <place reg="Baghdad, Turkey (Iraq)" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Bagdad</place>—the bulk of German power inserted into the heart of the world. If she can keep that, she has kept all that her dreams contemplated when the war began. If she can keep that, her power can disturb the world as long as she keeps it, always provided, for I feel bound to put this proviso in—always provided the present influences that control the German Government continue to control it. I believe that the spirit of freedom can get into the hearts of Germans and find as fine a welcome there as it can find in any other hearts, but the spirit of freedom does not suit the plans of the Pan-Germans. Power can not be used with concentrated force against free peoples if it is used by free people.</p>
         <p rend="center" xml:space="preserve"><space dim="vertical" extent="1" units="em"/>PEACE RUMORS.<space dim="vertical" extent="1" units="em"/></p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">You know how many intimations come to us from one of the central powers that it is more anxious for peace than the <placeRef reg="Germany" link-pointer-type="place">chief central power</placeRef>, and you know that it means that the people in that central power know that if the war ends as it stands they will in effect themselves be vassals of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Germany</place>, notwithstanding that their populations are compounded of all the peoples of that part of the world, and notwithstanding the fact that they do not wish in their pride and proper spirit of nationality to be so absorbed and dominated. <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Germany</place> is determined that the political power of the world shall belong to her. There have been such ambitions before. They have been in part realized, but never before have those ambitions been based upon so exact and precise and scientific a plan of domination.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">May I not say that it is amazing to me that any group of persons should be so ill-informed as to suppose, as some groups in <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Russia</place> apparently suppose, that any reforms planned in the interest of the people can live in the presence of a <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Germany</place> powerful enough to undermine or overthrow them by intrigue or force? Any body of free men that compounds with the present German Government is compounding for its own destruction. But that is not the whole of the story. Any man in <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> or anywhere else that supposes that the free industry and enterprise of the world can continue if the Pan-German plan is achieved and German power fastened upon the world is as fatuous as the dreamers in <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Russia</place>. What I am opposed to is not the feeling of the pacifists, but their stupidity. My heart is with them, but my mind has a contempt for them. I want peace, but I know how to get it, and they do not.</p>
         <p rend="center" xml:space="preserve"><space dim="vertical" extent="1" units="em"/><person refurl="x4005028" reg="Edward M. House" link-pointer-type="person">COL. HOUSE’S</person> MISSION.<space dim="vertical" extent="1" units="em"/></p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">You will notice that I sent a friend of mine, <person refurl="x4005028" reg="Edward M. House" link-pointer-type="person">Col. House</person>, to <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Europe</place>, who is as great a lover of peace as any man in the world; but I didn’t send him on a peace mission yet. I sent him to take part in a conference as to how the war was to be won, and he knows, as I know, that that is the way to get peace, if you want it for more than a few minutes.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">All of this is a preface to the conference that I have referred to with regard to what we are going to do. If we are true friends of freedom, our own or anybody else’s, we will see that the power of this country and the productivity of this country is raised to its absolute maximum, and that absolutely nobody is allowed to stand in the way of it. When I say that nobody is allowed to stand in the way I do not mean that they shall be prevented by the power of the Government but by the power of the American spirit. Our duty, if we are to do this great thing and show <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> to be what we believe her to be—the greatest hope and energy of the world—is to stand together night and day until the job is finished.</p>
         <p rend="center" xml:space="preserve"><space dim="vertical" extent="1" units="em"/>LABOR MUST BE FREE. <space dim="vertical" extent="1" units="em"/></p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">While we are fighting for freedom we must see, among other things, that labor is free; and that means a number of interesting things. It means not only that we must do what we have declared our purpose to do, see that the conditions of labor are not rendered more onerous by the war, but also that we shall see to it that the instrumentalities by which the conditions of labor are improved are not blocked or checked. That we must do. That has been the matter about which I have taken pleasure in conferring from time to time with your president, <person refurl="x4005178" reg="Samuel Gompers" link-pointer-type="person">Mr. Gompers</person>; and if I may be permitted to do so, I want to express my admiration of his patriotic courage, his large vision, and his statesmanlike sense of what has to be done. I like to lay my mind alongside of a mind that knows how to pull in harness. The horses that kick over the traces will have to be put in corral.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Now, to stand together means that nobody must interrupt the processes of our energy if the interruption can possibly be avoided without the absolute invasion of freedom. To put it concretely, that means this: Nobody has a right to stop the processes of labor until all the methods of conciliation and settlement have been exhausted. And I might as well say right here that I am not talking to you alone. You sometimes stop the courses of labor, but there are others who do the same, and I believe I am speaking from my own experience not only, but from the experience of others when I say that you are reasonable in a larger number of cases than the capitalists. I am not saying these things to them personally yet, because I have not had a chance, but they have to be said, not in any spirit of criticism, but in order to clear the atmosphere and come down to business. Everybody on both sides has now got to transact business, and a settlement is never impossible when both sides want to do the square and right thing.</p>
         <p rend="center" xml:space="preserve"><space dim="vertical" extent="1" units="em"/>SETTLEMENT HARD TO AVOID.<space dim="vertical" extent="1" units="em"/></p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Moreover, a settlement is always hard to avoid when the parties can be brought face to face. I can differ from a man much more radically when he is not in the room than I can when he is in the room, because then the awkward thing is he can come back at me and answer what I say. It is always dangerous for a man to have the floor entirely to himself. Therefore, we must insist in every instance that the parties come into each other’s presence and there discuss the issues between them, and not separately in places which have no communication with each other. I always like to remind myself of a delightful saying of an Englishman of the past generation, <person refurl="x4000426" reg="Charles Lamb" link-pointer-type="person">Charles Lamb</person>. He stuttered a little bit, and once when he was with a group of friends he spoke very harshly of some man who was not present. One of his friends said: “Why, <person refurl="x4000426" reg="Charles Lamb" link-pointer-type="person">Charles</person> I didn’t know that you knew so and so.” “O-o-oh,” he said, “I-I d-d-don’t; I-I can’t h-h-hate a m-m-man I-I know.” There is a great deal of human nature, of very pleasant human nature, in the saying. It is hard to hate a man you know. I may admit, parenthetically, that there are some politicians whose methods I do not at all believe in, but they are jolly good fellows, and if they only would not talk the wrong kind of politics to me, I would love to be with them.</p>
         <p rend="center" xml:space="preserve"><space dim="vertical" extent="1" units="em"/>NO SYMPATHY WITH MOB SPIRIT.<space dim="vertical" extent="1" units="em"/></p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">So it is all along the line, in serious matters and things less serious. We are all of the same clay and spirit, and we can get together if we desire to get together. Therefore, my counsel to you is this: Let us show ourselves Americans by showing that we do not want to go off in separate camps or groups by ourselves, but that we want to cooperate with all other classes and all other groups in the common enterprise which is to release the spirits of the world from bondage. I would be willing to set that up as the final test of an American. That is the meaning of democracy. I have been very much distressed, my fellow citizens, by some of the things that have happened recently. The mob spirit is displaying itself here and there in this country. I have no sympathy with what some men are saying, but I have no sympathy with the men who take their punishment into their own hands; and I want to say to every man who does join such a mob that I do not recognize him as worthy of the free institutions of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place>. There are some organizations in this country whose object is anarchy and the destruction of law, but I would not meet their efforts by making myself partner in destroying the law. I despise and hate their purposes as much as any man, but I respect the ancient processes of justice; and I would be too proud not to see them done justice, however wrong they are.</p>
         <p rend="center" xml:space="preserve"><space dim="vertical" extent="1" units="em"/>MUST OBEY COMMON COUNSEL.<space dim="vertical" extent="1" units="em"/></p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">So I want to utter my earnest protest against any manifestation of the spirit of lawlessness anywhere or in any cause. Why, gentlemen, look what it means. We claim to be the greatest democratic people in the world, and democracy means first of all that we can govern ourselves. If our men have not self-control, then they are not capable of that great thing which we call democratic government. A man who takes the law into his own hands is not the right man to cooperate in any formation or development of law and institutions, and some of the processes by which the struggle between capital and labor is carried on are processes that come very near to taking the law into your own hands. I do not mean for a moment to compare them with what I have just been speaking of, but I want you to see that they are mere gradations in this manifestation of the unwillingness to cooperate, and that the fundamental lesson of the whole situation is that we must not only take common counsel, but that we must yield to and obey common counsel. Not all of the instrumentalities for this are at hand. I am hopeful that in the very near future new instrumentalities may be organized by which we can see to it that various things that are now going on ought not to go on. There are various processes of the dilution of labor and the unnecessary substitution of labor and the bidding in distant markets and unfairly upsetting the whole competition of labor which ought not to go on. I mean now on the part of employers, and we must interject some instrumentality of cooperation by which the fair thing will be done all around. I am hopeful that some such instrumentalities may be devised, but whether they are or not, we must use those that we have and upon every occasion where it is necessary have such an instrumentality originated upon that occasion.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">So, my fellow citizens, the reason I came away from <place reg="Washington, DC" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Washington</place> is that I sometimes get lonely down here. So many people come to <place reg="Washington, DC" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Washington</place> who know things that are not so, and so few people who know anything about what the people of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> are thinking about. I have to come away and get reminded of the rest of the country. I have to come away and talk to men who are up against the real thing, and say to them, “I am with you if you are with me.” And the only test of being with me is not to think about me personally at all, but merely to think of me as the expression for the time being of the power and dignity and hope of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place>.</p>

         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve"><render as="smallcap" rend="inherit">Gentlemen of the Congress</render> Eight months have elapsed since I last had the <word>honour</word> of addressing you. They have been months crowded with events of immense and grave significance for us. I shall not undertake to retail or even to summarize those events. The practical particulars of the part we have played in them will be laid before you in the reports of the Executive Departments. I shall discuss only our present outlook upon these vast affairs, our present duties, and the immediate means of accomplishing the objects we shall hold always in view.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I shall not go back to debate the causes of the <abbr expan="World War I">war</abbr>. The intolerable wrongs done and planned against us by the sinister masters of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Germany</place> have long since become too grossly obvious and odious to every true American to need to be rehearsed. But I shall ask you to consider again and with a very grave scrutiny our objectives and the measures by which we mean to attain them; for the purpose of discussion here in this place is action, and our action must move straight towards definite ends. Our object is, of course, to win the war; and we shall not slacken or suffer ourselves to be diverted until it is won. But it is worth while asking and answering the question, When shall we consider the war won?</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">From one point of view it is not necessary to broach this fundamental matter. I do not doubt that the American people know what the war is about and what sort of an outcome they will regard as a realization of their purpose in it. As a nation we are united in spirit and intention. I pay little heed to those who tell me otherwise. I hear the voices of dissent,—who does not? I hear the criticism and the <word altform="clamor">clamour</word> of the noisily thoughtless and troublesome. I also see men here and there fling themselves in impotent disloyalty against the calm, indomitable power of the nation. I hear men debate peace who understand neither its nature nor the way in which we may attain it with uplifted eyes and unbroken spirits. But I know that none of these speaks for the nation. They do not touch the heart of anything. They may safely be left to strut their uneasy hour and be forgotten.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">But from another point of view I believe that it is necessary to say plainly what we here at the seat of action consider the war to be for and what part we mean to play in the settlement of its searching issues. We are the spokesmen of the American people and they have a right to know whether their purpose is ours. They desire peace by the overcoming of evil, by the defeat once for all of the sinister forces that interrupt peace and render it impossible, and they wish to know how closely our thought runs with theirs and what action we propose. They are impatient with those who desire peace by any sort of compromise,—deeply and indignantly impatient,—but they will be equally impatient with us if we do not make it plain to them what our objectives are and what we are planning for in seeking to make conquest of peace by arms.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I believe that I speak for them when I say two things: First, that this intolerable Thing of which the masters of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Germany</place> have shown us the ugly face, this menace of combined intrigue and force which we now see so clearly as the German power, a Thing without conscience or <word altform="honor">honour</word> or capacity for covenanted peace, must be crushed and, if it be not utterly brought to an end, at least shut out from the friendly intercourse of the nations; and, second, that when this Thing and its power are indeed defeated and the time comes that we can discuss peace,—when the German people have spokesmen whose word we can believe and when those spokesmen are ready in the name of their people to accept the common judgment of the nations as to what shall henceforth be the bases of law and of covenant for the life of the world,—we shall be willing and glad to pay the full price for peace, and pay it ungrudgingly. We know what that price will be. It will be full, impartial justice,—justice done at every point and to every nation that the final settlement must affect, our enemies as well as our friends.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">You catch, with me, the voices of humanity that are in the air. They grow daily more audible, more articulate, more persuasive, and they come from the hearts of men everywhere. They insist that the war shall not end in vindictive action of any kind; that no nation or people shall be robbed or punished because the irresponsible rulers of a single country have themselves done deep and abominable wrong. It is this thought that has been expressed in the formula ‘No annexations, no contributions, no punitive indemnities.’ Just because this crude formula expresses the instinctive judgment as to right of plain men everywhere it has been made diligent use of by the masters of German intrigue to lead the people of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Russia</place> astray—and the people of every other country their agents could reach, in order that a premature peace might be brought about before autocracy has been taught its final and convincing lesson, and the people of the world put in control of their own destinies.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">But the fact that a wrong use has been made of a just idea is no reason why a right use should not be made of it. It ought to be brought under the patronage of its real friends. Let it be said again that autocracy must first be shown the utter futility of its claims to power or leadership in the modern world. It is impossible to apply any standard of justice so long as such forces are unchecked and undefeated as the present masters of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Germany</place> command. Not until that has been done can Right be set up as arbiter and peace-maker among the nations. But when that has been done,—as, God willing, it assuredly will be,—we shall at last be free to do an unprecedented thing, and this is the time to avow our purpose to do it. We shall be free to base peace on generosity and justice, to the exclusion of all selfish claims to advantage even on the part of the victors.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Let there be no misunderstanding. Our present and immediate task is to win the war, and nothing shall turn us aside from it until it is accomplished. Every power and resource we possess, whether of men, of money, or of materials, is being devoted and will continue to be devoted to that purpose until it is achieved. Those who desire to bring peace about before that purpose is achieved I counsel to carry their advice elsewhere. We will not entertain it. We shall regard the war as won only when the German people say to us, through properly accredited representatives, that they are ready to agree to a settlement based upon justice and the reparation of the wrongs their rulers have done. They have done a wrong to <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Belgium</place> which must be repaired. They have established a power over other lands and peoples than their own,—over the great Empire of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Austria-Hungary</place>, over hitherto free <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Balkan states</place>, over <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Turkey</place>, and within <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Asia</place>,—which must be relinquished.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve"><place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Germany’s</place> success by skill, by industry, by knowledge, by enterprise we did not grudge or oppose, but admired, rather. She had built up for herself a real empire of trade and influence, secured by the peace of the world. We were content to abide the rivalries of manufacture, science, and commerce that were involved for us in her success and stand or fall as we had or did not have the brains and the initiative to surpass her. But at the moment when she had conspicuously won her triumphs of peace she threw them away, to establish in their stead what the world will no longer permit to be established, military and political domination by arms, by which to oust where she could not excel the rivals she most feared and hated. The peace we make must remedy that wrong. It must deliver the once fair lands and happy peoples of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Belgium</place> and northern <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">France</place> from the Prussian conquest and the Prussian menace, but it must also deliver the peoples of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Austria-Hungary</place>, the peoples of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Balkans</place>, and the peoples of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Turkey</place>, alike in <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Europe</place> and in <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Asia</place>, from the impudent and alien dominion of the Prussian military and commercial autocracy.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">We owe it, however, to ourselves to say that we do not wish in any way to impair or to rearrange the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Austro-Hungarian Empire</place>. It is no affair of ours what they do with their own life, either industrially or politically. We do not purpose or desire to dictate to them in any way. We only desire to see that their affairs are left in their own hands, in all matters, great or small. We shall hope to secure for the peoples of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Balkan peninsula</place> and for the people of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Turkish Empire</place> the right and opportunity to make their own lives safe, their own fortunes secure against oppression or injustice and from the dictation of foreign courts or parties.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">And our attitude and purpose with regard to <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Germany</place> herself are of a like kind. We intend no wrong against the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">German Empire</place>, no interference with her internal affairs. We should deem either the one or the other absolutely unjustifiable, absolutely contrary to the principles we have professed to live by and to hold most sacred throughout our life as a nation.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The people of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Germany</place> are being told by the men whom they now permit to deceive them and to act as their masters that they are fighting for the very life and existence of their Empire, a war of desperate self-defense against deliberate aggression. Nothing could be more grossly or wantonly false, and we must seek by the utmost openness and <word altform="candor">candour</word> as to our real aims to convince them of its falseness. We are in fact fighting for their emancipation from fear, along with our own,—from the fear as well as from the fact of unjust attack by <word altform="neighbors">neighbours</word> or rivals or schemers after world empire. No one is threatening the existence or the independence or the peaceful enterprise of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">German Empire</place>.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The worst that can happen to the detriment of the German people is this, that if they should still, after the war is over, continue to be obliged to live under ambitious and intriguing masters interested to disturb the peace of the world, men or classes of men whom the other peoples of the world could not trust, it might be impossible to admit them to the partnership of nations which must henceforth guarantee the world’s peace. That partnership must be a partnership of peoples, not a mere partnership of governments. It might be impossible, also, in such untoward circumstances, to admit <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Germany</place> to the free economic intercourse which must inevitably spring out of the other partnerships of a real peace. But there would be no aggression in that; and such a situation, inevitable because of distrust, would in the very nature of things sooner or later cure itself, by processes which would assuredly set in.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The wrongs, the very deep wrongs, committed in this war will have to be righted. That of course. But they cannot and must not be righted by the commission of similar wrongs against <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Germany</place> and her allies. The world will not permit the commission of similar wrongs as a means of reparation and settlement. Statesmen must by this time have learned that the opinion of the world is everywhere wide awake and fully comprehends the issues involved. No representative of any self-governed nation will dare disregard it by attempting any such covenants of selfishness and compromise as were entered into at the Congress of <place reg="Vienna, Austria" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Vienna</place>. The thought of the plain people here and everywhere throughout the world, the people who enjoy no privilege and have very simple and unsophisticated standards of right and wrong, is the air all governments must henceforth breathe if they would live. It is in the full disclosing light of that thought that all policies must be conceived and executed in this midday hour of the world’s life. German rulers have been able to upset the peace of the world only because the German people were not suffered under their tutelage to share the comradeship of the other peoples of the world either in thought or in purpose. They were allowed to have no opinion of their own which might be set up as a rule of conduct for those who exercised authority over them. But the congress that concludes this war will feel the full strength of the tides that run now in the hearts and conscience of free men everywhere. Its conclusions will run with those tides.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">All these things have been true from the very beginning of this stupendous war; and I can not help thinking that if they had been made plain at the very outset the sympathy and enthusiasm of the Russian people might have been once for all enlisted on the side of the Allies, suspicion and distrust swept away, and a real and lasting union of purpose effected. Had they believed these things at the very moment of their revolution and had they been confirmed in that belief since, the sad reverses which have recently marked the progress of their affairs toward an ordered and stable government of free men might have been avoided. The Russian people have been poisoned by the very same falsehoods that have kept the German people in the dark, and the poison has been administered by the very same hands. The only possible antidote is the truth. It can not be uttered too plainly or too often.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">From every point of view, therefore, it has semed to be my duty to speak these declarations of purpose, to add these specific interpretations to what I took the liberty of <link refurl="4003428" link-pointer-type="RelatedDoc" rend="inherit"
                  xml:space="preserve">saying to the Senate in January</link>. Our entrance into the war has not altered our attitude towards the settlement that must come when it is over. When I said in January that the nations of the world were entitled not only to free pathways upon the sea but also to assured and unmolested access to those pathways I was thinking, and I am thinking now, not of the smaller and weaker nations alone, which need our countenance and support, but also of the great and powerful nations, and of our present enemies as well as our present associates in the war. I was thinking, and am thinking now, of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Austria</place> herself, among the rest, as well as of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Serbia</place> and of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Poland</place>. Justice and equality of rights can be had only at a great price. We are seeking permanent, not temporary, foundations for the peace of the world and must seek them candidly and fearlessly. As always, the right will prove to be the expedient.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">What shall we do, then, to push this great war of freedom and justice to its righteous conclusion? We must clear away with a thorough hand all impediments to success and we must make every adjustment of law that will facilitate the full and free use of our whole capacity and force as a fighting unit.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">One very embarrassing obstacle that stands in our way is that we are at war with <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Germany</place> but not with her allies. I therefore very earnestly recommend that the Congress immediately declare the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> in a state of war with <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Austria-Hungary</place>. Does it seem strange to you that this should be the conclusion of the argument I have just addressed to you? It is not. It is in fact the inevitable logic of what I have said. <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Austria-Hungary</place> is for the time being not her own mistress but simply the vassal of the German Government. We must face the facts as they are and act upon them without sentiment in this stern business. The government of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Austria-Hungary</place> is not acting upon its own initiative or in response to the wishes and feelings of its own peoples but as the instrument of another nation. We must meet its force with our own and regard the Central Powers as but one. The war can be successfully conducted in no other way. The same logic would lead also to a declaration of war against <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Turkey</place> and <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Bulgaria</place>. They also are the tools of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Germany</place>. But they are mere tools and do not yet stand in the direct path of our necessary action. We shall go wherever the necessities of this war carry us, but it seems to me that we should go only where immediate and practical considerations lead us and not heed any others.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The financial and military measures which must be adopted will suggest themselves as the war and its undertakings develop, but I will take the liberty of proposing to you certain other acts of legislation which seem to me to be needed for the support of the war and for the release of our whole force and energy.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">It will be necessary to extend in certain particulars the legislation of the last session with regard to alien enemies; and also necessary, I believe, to create a very definite and particular control over the entrance and departure of all persons into and from the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place>.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Legislation should be enacted defining as a criminal offense every wilful violation of the presidential proclamations relating to alien enemies promulgated under section 4067 of the Revised Statutes and providing appropriate punishments; and women as well as men should be included under the terms of the acts placing restraints upon alien enemies. It is likely that as time goes on many alien enemies will be willing to be fed and housed at the expense of the Government in the detention camps and it would be the purpose of the legislation I have suggested to confine offenders among them in penitentiaries and other similar institutions where they could be made to work as other criminals do.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Recent experience has convinced me that the Congress must go further in authorizing the Government to set limits to prices. The law of supply and demand, I am sorry to say, has been replaced by the law of unrestricted selfishness. While we have eliminated profiteering in several branches of industry it still runs impudently rampant in others. The farmers, for example, complain with a great deal of justice that, while the regulation of food prices restricts their incomes, no restraints are placed upon the prices of most of the things they must themselves purchase; and similar inequities obtain on all sides.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">It is imperatively necessary that the consideration of the full use of the water power of the country and also the consideration of the systematic and yet economical development of such of the natural resources of the country as are still under the control of the federal government should be immediately resumed and affirmatively and constructively dealt with at the earliest possible moment. The pressing need of such legislation is daily becoming more obvious.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The legislation proposed at the last session with regard to regulated combinations among our exporters, in order to provide for our foreign trade a more effective organization and method of cooperation, ought by all means to be completed at this session.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">And I beg that the members of the House of Representatives will permit me to express the opinion that it will be impossible to deal in any but a very wasteful and extravagant fashion with the enormous appropriations of the public moneys which must continue to be made, if the war is to be properly sustained, unless the House will consent to return to its former practice of initiating and preparing all appropriation bills through a single committee, in order that responsibility may be <word altform="centered">centred</word>, expenditures standardized and made uniform, and waste and duplication as much as possible avoided.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Additional legislation may also become necessary before the present Congress again adjourns in order to effect the most efficient coordination and operation of the railway and other transportation systems of the country; but to that I shall, if circumstances should demand, call the attention of the Congress upon another occasion.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">If I have overlooked anything that ought to be done for the more effective conduct of the war, your own counsels will supply the omission. What I am perfectly clear about is that in the present session of the Congress our whole attention and energy should be concentrated on the vigorous, rapid, and successful prosecution of the great task of winning the war.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">We can do this with all the greater zeal and enthusiasm because we know that for us this is a war of high principle, debased by no selfish ambition of conquest or spoliation; because we know, and all the world knows, that we have been forced into it to save the very institutions we live under from corruption and destruction. The purposes of the Central Powers strike straight at the very heart of everything we believe in; their methods of warfare outrage every principle of humanity and of knightly <word altform="honor">honour</word>; their intrigue has corrupted the very thought and spirit of many of our people; their sinister and secret diplomacy has sought to take our very territory away from us and disrupt the Union of the States. Our safety would be at an end, our <word altform="honor">honour</word> forever sullied and brought into contempt were we to permit their triumph. They are striking at the very existence of democracy and liberty.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">It is because it is for us a war of high, disinterested purpose, in which all the free peoples of the world are banded together for the vindication of right, a war for the preservation of our nation and of all that it has held dear of principle and of purpose, that we feel ourselves doubly constrained to propose for its outcome only that which is righteous and of irreproachable intention, for our foes as well as for our friends. The cause being just and holy, the settlement must be of like motive and quality. For this we can fight, but for nothing less noble or less worthy of our traditions. For this cause we entered the war and for this cause will we battle until the last gun is fired.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I have spoken plainly because this seems to me the time when it is most necessary to speak plainly, in order that all the world may know that even in the heat and <word altform="ardor">ardour</word> of the struggle and when our whole thought is of carrying the war through to its end we have not forgotten any ideal or principle for which the name of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> has been held in <word altform="honor">honour</word> among the nations and for which it has been our glory to contend in the great generations that went before us. A supreme moment of history has come. The eyes of the people have been opened and they see. The hand of God is laid upon the nations. He will show them <word altform="favor">favour</word>, I devoutly believe, only if they rise to the clear heights of His own justice and mercy.</p>

         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve"><render as="smallcap" rend="inherit">Gentlemen of the Congress</render>: I have asked the privilege of addressing you in order to report to you that on the <date value="1917-12-28">twenty-eighth of December last</date>, during the recess of the Congress, acting through the <personRef refurl="x4000737" reg="Newton D. Baker" link-pointer-type="person">Secretary of War</personRef> and under the authority conferred upon me by the Act of Congress approved <date value="1916-08-29">August 29, 1916</date>, I took possession and assumed control of the railway lines of the country and the systems of water transportation under their control. This step seemed to be imperatively necessary in the interest of the public welfare, in the presence of the great tasks of war with which we are now dealing. As our own experience develops difficulties and makes it clear what they are, I have deemed it my duty to remove those difficulties wherever I have the legal power to do so. To assume control of the vast railway systems of the country is, I realize, a very great responsibility, but to fail to do so in the existing circumstances would have been a much greater. I assumed the less responsibility rather than the weightier.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I am sure that I am speaking the mind of all thoughtful Americans when I say that it is our duty as the representatives of the nation to do everything that it is necessary to do to secure the complete mobilization of the whole resources of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> by as rapid and effective means as can be found. Transportation supplies all the arteries of mobilization. Unless it be under a single and unified direction, the whole process of the nation’s action is embarrassed.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">It was in the true spirit of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place>, and it was right, that we should first try to effect the necessary unification under the voluntary action of those who were in charge of the great railway properties; and we did try it. The directors of the railways responded to the need promptly and generously. The group of railway executives who were charged with the task of actual coordination and general direction performed their difficult duties with patriotic zeal and marked ability, as was to have been expected, and did, I believe, everything that it was possible for them to do in the circumstances. If I have taken the task out of their hands, it has not been because of any dereliction or failure on their part but only because there were some things which the Government can do and private management cannot. We shall continue to value most highly the advice and assistance of these gentlemen and I am sure we shall not find them withholding it.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">It had become unmistakably plain that only under government administration can the entire equipment of the several systems of transportation be fully and unreservedly thrown into a common service without injurious discrimination against particular properties. Only under government administration can an absolutely unrestricted and unembarrassed common use be made of all tracks, terminals, terminal facilities and equipment of every kind. Only under that authority can new terminals be constructed and developed without regard to the requirements or limitations of particular roads. But under government administration all these things will be possible,—not instantly, but as fast as practical difficulties, which cannot be merely conjured away, give way before the new management.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The common administration will be carried out with as little disturbance of the present operating organizations and personnel of the railways as possible. Nothing will be altered or disturbed which it is not necessary to disturb. We are serving the public interest and safeguarding the public safety, but we are also regardful of the interest of those by whom these great properties are owned and glad to avail ourselves of the experience and trained ability of those who have been managing them. It is necessary that the transportation of troops and of war materials, of food and of fuel, and of everything that is necessary for the full mobilization of the energies and resources of the country, should be first considered, but it is clearly in the public interest also that the ordinary activities and the normal industrial and commercial life of the country should be interfered with and dislocated as little as possible, and the public may rest assured that the interest and convenience of the private shipper will be as carefully served and safeguarded as it is possible to serve and safeguard it in the present extraordinary circumstances.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">While the present authority of the Executive suffices for all purposes of administration, and while of course all private interests must for the present give way to the public necessity, it is, I am sure you will agree with me, right and necessary that the owners and creditors of the railways, the holders of their stocks and bonds, should receive from the Government an unqualified guarantee that their properties will be maintained throughout the period of federal control in as good repair and as complete equipment as at present, and that the several roads will receive under federal management such compensation as is equitable and just alike to their owners and to the general public. I would suggest the average net railway operating income of the three years ending <date value="1917-06-30">June 30, 1917</date>. I earnestly recommend that these guarantees be given by appropriate legislation, and given as promptly as circumstances permit.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I need not point out the essential justice of such guarantees and their great influence and significance as elements in the present financial and industrial situation of the country. Indeed, one of the strong arguments for assuming control of the railroads at this time is the financial argument. It is necessary that the values of railway securities should be justly and fairly protected and that the large financial operations every year necessary in connection with the maintenance, operation and development of the roads should, during the period of the war, be wisely related to the financial operations of the Government. Our first duty is, of course, to conserve the common interest and the common safety and to make certain that nothing stands in the way of the successful prosecution of the great war for liberty and justice, but it is also an obligation of public conscience and of public honor that the private interests we disturb should be kept safe from unjust injury, and it is of the utmost consequence to the Government itself that all great financial operations should be stabilized and coordinated with the financial operations of the Government. No borrowing should run athwart the borrowings of the federal treasury, and no fundamental industrial values should anywhere be unnecessarily impaired. In the hands of many thousands of small investors in the country, as well as in national banks, in insurance companies, in savings banks, in trust companies, in financial agencies of every kind, railway securities, the sum total of which runs up to some ten or eleven thousand millions, constitute a vital part of the structure of credit, and the unquestioned solidity of that structure must be maintained.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The <personRef refurl="x4000737" reg="Newton D. Baker" link-pointer-type="person">Secretary of War</personRef> and I easily agreed that, in view of the many complex interests which must be safeguarded and harmonized, as well as because of his exceptional experience and ability in this new field of governmental action, the <person refurl="x4005032" reg="William G. McAdoo" link-pointer-type="person">Honorable William G. McAdoo</person> was the right man to assume direct administrative control of this new executive task. At our request, he consented to assume the authority and duties of organizer and Director General of the new Railway Administration. He has assumed those duties and his work is in active progress.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">It is probably too much to expect that even under the unified railway administration which will now be possible sufficient economies can be effected in the operation of the railways to make it possible to add to their equipment and extend their operative facilities as much as the present extraordinary demands upon their use will render desirable without resorting to the national treasury for the funds. If it is not possible, it will, of course, be necessary to resort to the Congress for grants of money for that purpose. The <personRef refurl="x4002290" reg="Carter Glass" link-pointer-type="person">Secretary of the Treasury</personRef> will advise with your committees with regard to this very practical aspect of the matter. For the present, I suggest only the guarantees I have indicated and such appropriations as are necessary at the outset of this task. I take the liberty of expressing the hope that the Congress may grant these promptly and ungrudgingly. We are dealing with great matters and will, I am sure, deal with them greatly.</p>

         <p rend="noindent" xml:space="preserve"><render as="smallcap" rend="inherit">Gentlemen of the Congress</render>:</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Once more, as repeatedly before, the spokesmen of the Central Empires have indicated their desire to discuss the objects of the war and the possible bases of a general peace. Parleys have been in progress at <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Brest-Litovsk</place> between Russian representatives of the representatives of the Central Powers to which the attention of all the belligerents has been invited for the purpose of ascertaining whether it may be possible to extend these parleys into a general conference with regard to terms of peace and settlement. The Russian representatives presented not only a perfectly definite statement of the principles upon which they would be willing to conclude peace but also an equally definite <word altform="program">programme</word> of the concrete application of those principles. The representatives of the Central Powers, on their part, presented an outline of settlement which, if much less definite, seemed susceptible of liberal interpretation until their specific <word altform="program">programme</word> of practical terms was added. That <word altform="program">programme</word> proposed no concessions at all either to the sovereignty of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Russia</place> or to the preferences of the populations with whose fortunes it dealt, but meant, in a word, that the Central Empires were to keep every foot of territory their armed forces had occupied,—every province, every city, every point of vantage,—as a permanent addition to their territories and their power. It is a reasonable conjecture that the general principles of settlement which they at first suggested originated with the more liberal statesmen of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Germany</place> and <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Austria</place>, the men who have begun to feel the force of their own peoples’ thought and purpose, while the concrete terms of actual settlement came from the military leaders who have no thought but to keep what they have got. The negotiations have been broken off. The Russian representatives were sincere and in earnest. They cannot entertain such proposals of conquest and domination.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The whole incident is full of significance. It is also full of perplexity. With whom are the Russian representatives dealing? For whom are the representatives of the Central Empires speaking? Are they speaking for the majorities of their respective parliaments or for the minority parties, that military and imperialistic minority which has so far dominated their whole policy and controlled the affairs of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Turkey</place> and of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Balkan states</place> which have felt obliged to become their associates in this war? The Russian representatives have insisted, very justly, very wisely, and in the true spirit of modern democracy, that the conferences they have been holding with the Teutonic and Turkish statesmen should be held within open, not closed, doors, and all the world has been audience, as was desired. To whom have we been listening, then? To those who speak the spirit and intention of the Resolutions of the German Reichstag of the <date value="1917-07-09">ninth of July last</date>, the spirit and intention of the liberal leaders and parties of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Germany</place>, or to those who resist and defy that spirit and intention and insist upon conquest and subjugation? Or are we listening, in fact, to both, unreconciled and in open and hopeless contradiction? These are very serious and pregnant questions. Upon the answer to them depends the peace of the world.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">But, whatever the results of the parleys at <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Brest-Litovsk</place>, whatever the confusions of counsel and of purpose in the utterances of the spokesmen of the Central Empires, they have again attempted to acquaint the world with their objects in the war and have again challenged their adversaries to say what their objects are and what sort of settlement they would deem just and satisfactory. There is no good reason why that challenge should not be responded to, and responded to with the utmost candor. We did not wait for it. Not once, but again and again, we have laid our whole thought and purpose before the world, not in general terms only, but each time with sufficient definition to make it clear what sort of definitive terms of settlement must necessarily spring out of them. Within the last week <person refurl="x4004689" reg="David Lloyd George" link-pointer-type="person">Mr. Lloyd George</person> has spoken with admirable candor and in admirable spirit for the people and Government of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Great Britain</place>. There is no confusion of counsel among the adversaries of the Central Powers, no uncertainty of principle, no vagueness of detail. The only secrecy of counsel, the only lack of fearless frankness, the only failure to make definite statement of the objects of the war, lies with <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Germany</place> and her Allies. The issues of life and death hang upon these definitions. No statesman who has the least conception of his responsibility ought for a moment to permit himself to continue this tragical and appalling outpouring of blood and treasure unless he is sure beyond a peradventure that the objects of the vital sacrifice are part and parcel of the very life of Society and that the people for whom he speaks think them right and imperative as he does.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">There is, moreover, a voice calling for these definitions of principle and of purpose which is, it seems to me, more thrilling and more compelling than any of the many moving voices with which the troubled air of the world is filled. It is the voice of the Russian people. They are prostrate and all but helpless, it would seem, before the grim power of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Germany</place>, which has hitherto known no relenting and no pity. Their power, apparently, is shattered. And yet their soul is not subservient. They will not yield either in principle or in action. Their conception of what is right, of what it is humane and honorable for them to accept, has been stated with a frankness, a largeness of view, a generosity of spirit, and a universal human sympathy which must challenge the admiration of every friend of mankind; and they have refused to compound their ideals or desert others that they themselves may be safe. They call to us to say what it is that we desire, in what, if in anything, our purpose and our spirit differ from theirs; and I believe that the people of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> would wish me to respond, with utter simplicity and frankness. Whether their present leaders believe it or not, it is our heartfelt desire and hope that some way may be opened whereby we may be privileged to assist the people of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Russia</place> to attain their utmost hope of liberty and ordered peace.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">It will be our wish and purpose that the processes of peace, when they are begun, shall be absolutely open and that they shall involve and permit henceforth no secret understandings of any kind. The day of conquest and aggrandizement is gone by; so is also the day of secret covenants entered into in the interest of particular governments and likely at some unlooked-for moment to upset the peace of the world. It is this happy fact, now clear to the view of every public man whose thoughts do not still linger in an age that is dead and gone, which makes it possible for every nation whose purposes are consistent with justice and the peace of the world to avow now or at any other time the objects it has in view.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">We entered this war because violations of right had occurred which touched us to the quick and made the life of our own people impossible unless they were corrected and the world secured once for all against their recurrence. What we demand in this war, therefore, is nothing peculiar to ourselves. It is that the world be made fit and safe to live in; and particularly that it be made safe for every peace-loving nation which, like our own, wishes to live its own life, determine its own institutions, be assured of justice and fair dealing by the other peoples of the world as against force and selfish aggression. All the peoples of the world are in effect partners in this interest, and for our own part we see very clearly that unless justice be done to others it will not be done to us. The <word altform="program">programme</word> of the world’s peace, therefore, is our <word altform="program">programme</word>; and that <word altform="program">programme</word>, the only possible <word altform="program">programme</word>, as we see it, is this:</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I. Open covenants of peace, openly arrived at, after which there shall be no private international understandings of any kind but diplomacy shall proceed always frankly and in the public view.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">II. Absolute freedom of navigation upon the seas, outside territorial waters, alike in peace and in war, except as the seas may be closed in whole or in part by international action for the enforcement of international covenants.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">III. The removal, so far as possible, of all economic barriers and the establishment of an equality of trade conditions among all the nations consenting to the peace and associating themselves for its maintenance.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">IV. Adequate guarantees given and taken that national armaments will be reduced to the lowest point consistent with domestic safety.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">V. A free, open-minded, and absolutely impartial adjustment of all colonial claims, based upon a strict observance of the principle that in determining all such questions of sovereignty the interests of the populations concerned must have equal weight with the equitable claims of the government whose title is to be determined.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">VI. The evacuation of all Russian territory and such a settlement of all questions affecting <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Russia</place> as will secure the best and freest cooperation of the other nations of the world in obtaining for her an unhampered and unembarrassed opportunity for the independent determination of her own political development and national policy and assure her of a sincere welcome into the society of free nations under institutions of her own choosing; and, more than a welcome, assistance also of every kind that she may need and may herself desire. The treatment accorded <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Russia</place> by her sister nations in the months to come will be the acid test of their good will, of their comprehension of her needs as distinguished from their own interests, and of their intelligent and unselfish sympathy.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">VII. <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Belgium</place>, the whole world will agree, must be evacuated and restored, without any attempt to limit the sovereignty which she enjoys in common with all other free nations. No other single act will serve as this will serve to restore confidence among the nations in the laws which they have themselves set and determined for the government of their relations with one another. Without this healing act the whole structure and validity of international law is forever impaired.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">VIII. All French territory should be freed and the invaded portions restored, and the wrong done to <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">France</place> by <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Prussia</place> in <date value="1871-99-99">1871</date> in the matter of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Alsace-Lorraine</place>, which has unsettled the peace of the world for nearly fifty years, should be righted, in order that peace may once more be made secure in the interest of all.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">IX. A readjustment of the frontiers of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Italy</place> should be effected along clearly recognizable lines of nationality.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">X. The peoples of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Austria-Hungary</place>, whose place among the nations we wish to see safeguarded and assured, should be accorded the freest opportunity of autonomous development.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">XI. <place reg="Romania" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Rumania</place>, <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Serbia</place>, and <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Montenegro</place> should be evacuated; occupied territories restored; <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Serbia</place> accorded free and secure access to the sea; and the relations of the several <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Balkan states</place> to one another determined by friendly counsel along historically established lines of allegiance and nationality; and international guarantees of the political and economic independence and territorial integrity of the several <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Balkan states</place> should be entered into.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">XII. The Turkish portions of the present <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Ottoman Empire</place> should be assured a secure sovereignty, but the other nationalities which are now under Turkish rule should be assured an undoubted security of life and an absolutely unmolested opportunity of autonomous development, and the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Dardanelles</place> should be permanently opened as a free passage to the ships and commerce of all nations under international guarantees.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">XIII. An independent <placeRef reg="Poland" link-pointer-type="place">Polish state</placeRef> should be erected which should include the territories inhabited by indisputably Polish populations, which should be assured a free and secure access to the sea, and whose political and economic independence and territorial integrity should be guaranteed by international covenant.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">XIV. A <word altform="League of Nations">general association of nations</word> must be formed under specific covenants for the purpose of affording mutual guarantees of political independence and territorial integrity to great and small states alike.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">In regard to these essential rectifications of wrong and assertions of right we feel ourselves to be intimate partners of all the governments and peoples associated together against the Imperialists. We cannot be separated in interest or divided in purpose. We stand together until the end.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">For such arrangements and covenants we are willing to fight and to continue to fight until they are achieved; but only because we wish the right to prevail and desire a just and stable peace such as can be secured only by removing the chief provocations to war, which this <word altform="program">programme</word> does remove. We have no jealousy of German greatness, and there is nothing in this <word altform="program">programme</word> that impairs it. We grudge her no achievement or distinction of learning or of pacific enterprise such as have made her record very bright and very enviable. We do not wish to injure her or to block in any way her legitimate influence or power. We do not wish to fight her either with arms or with hostile arrangements of trade if she is willing to associate herself with us and the other peace-loving nations of the world in covenants of justice and law and fair dealing. We wish her only to accept a place of equality among the peoples of the world,—the new world in which we now live,—instead of a place of mastery.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Neither do we presume to suggest to her any alteration or modification of her institutions. But it is necessary, we must frankly say, and necessary as a preliminary to any intelligent dealings with her on our part, that we should know whom her spokesmen speak for when they speak to us, whether for the Reichstag majority or for the military party and the men whose creed is imperial domination.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">We have spoken now, surely, in terms too concrete to admit of any further doubt or question. An evident principle runs through the whole <word altform="program">programme</word> I have outlined. It is the principle of justice to all peoples and nationalities, and their right to live on equal terms of liberty and safety with one another, whether they be strong or weak. Unless this principle be made its foundation no part of the structure of international justice can stand. The people of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> could act upon no other principle; and to the vindication of this principle they are ready to devote their lives, their honor, and everything that they possess. The moral climax of this the culminating and final war for human liberty has come, and they are ready to put their own strength, their own highest purpose, their own integrity and devotion to the test.</p>

         </H4>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I am very sorry indeed that I can not be present in person at the <place reg="Urbana, IL" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Urbana</place> conference. I should like to enjoy the benefit of the inspiration and exchange of counsel which I know I should obtain, but in the circumstances it has seemed impossible for me to be present, and therefore I can only send you a very earnest message expressing my interest and the thoughts which such a conference must bring prominently into every mind.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I need not tell you, for I am sure you realize as keenly as I do, that we are as a Nation in the presence of a great task which demands supreme sacrifice and endeavor of every one of us. We can give everything that is needed with the greater willingness, and even satisfaction, because the object of the war in which we are engaged is the greatest that free men have ever undertaken. It is to prevent the life of the world from being determined and the fortunes of men everywhere affected by small groups of military masters, who seek their own interest and the selfish dominion throughout the world of the Governments they unhappily for the moment control. You will not need to be convinced that it was necessary for us as a free people to take part in this war. It had raised its evil hand against us. The rulers of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Germany</place> had sought to exercise their power in such a way as to shut off our economic life so far as our intercourse with <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Europe</place> was concerned, and to confine our people within the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Western Hemisphere</place> while they accomplished purposes which would have permanently impaired and impeded every process of our national life and have put the fortunes of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> at the mercy of the Imperial Government of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Germany</place>.</p>
         <p rend="center" xml:space="preserve"><space dim="vertical" extent="1" units="em"/>REALITY, NOT MERELY A THREAT.<space dim="vertical" extent="1" units="em"/></p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">This was no threat. It had become a reality. Their hand of violence had been laid upon our own people and our own property in flagrant violation not only of justice but of the well-recognized and long-standing covenants of international law and treaty. We are fighting, therefore, as truly for the liberty and self-government of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> as if the war of our own Revolution had to be fought over again; and every man in every business in the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> must know by this time that his whole future fortune lies in the balance. Our national life and our whole economic development will pass under the sinister influences of foreign control if we do not win. We must win, therefore, and we shall win. I need not ask you to pledge your lives and fortunes with those of the rest of the Nation to the accomplishment of that great end.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">You will realize, as I think statesmen on both sides of the water realize, that the culminating crisis of the struggle has come and that the achievements of this year on the one side or the other must determine the issue. It has turned out that the forces that fight for freedom, the freedom of men all over the world as well as our own, depend upon us in an extraordinary and unexpected degree for sustenance, for the supply of the materials by which men are to live and to fight, and it will be our glory when the war is over that we have supplied those materials and supplied them abundantly, and it will be all the more glory because in supplying them we have made our supreme effort and sacrifice.</p>
         <p rend="center" xml:space="preserve"><space dim="vertical" extent="1" units="em"/>GREAT AGENCIES AT WORK.<space dim="vertical" extent="1" units="em"/></p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">In the field of agriculture we have agencies and instrumentalities, fortunately, such as no other government in the world can show. The Department of Agriculture is undoubtedly the greatest practical and scientific agricultural organization in the world. Its total annual budget of <currency type="U.S.A">$46,000,000</currency> has been increased during the last four years more than 72 per cent. It has a staff of 18,000, including a large number of highly trained experts, and alongside of it stands the unique land-grant colleges, which are without example elsewhere, and the 69 State and Federal experiment stations. These colleges and experiment stations have a total endowment of plant and equipment of <currency type="U.S.A">$172,000,000</currency> and an income of more than <currency type="U.S.A">$35,000,000</currency>, with 10,271 teachers, a resident student body of 125,000, and a vast additional number receiving instruction at their homes. County agents, joint officers of the Department of Agriculture and of the colleges, are everywhere cooperating with the farmers and assisting them. The number of extension workers under the Smith-Lever Act and under the recent emergency legislation has grown to 5,500 men and women working regularly in the various communities and taking to the farmer the latest scientific and practical information.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Alongside these great public agencies stand the very effective voluntary organizations among the farmers themselves which are more and more learning the best methods of cooperation and the best methods of putting to practical use the assistance derived from governmental sources. The banking legislation of the last two or three years has given the farmers access to the great lendable capital of the country, and it has become the duty both of the men in charge of the Federal Reserve Banking System and of the Farm Loan Banking System to see to it that the farmers obtain the credit, both short term and long term, to which they are not only entitled but which it is imperatively necessary should be extended to them if the present tasks of the country are to be adequately performed. Both by direct purchase of nitrates and by the establishment of plants to produce nitrates the Government is doing its utmost to assist in the problem of fertilization. The Department of Agriculture and other agencies are actively assisting the farmers to locate, safeguard, and secure at cost an adequate supply of sound seed. The department has <currency type="U.S.A">$2,500,000</currency> available for this purpose now and has asked the Congress for <currency type="U.S.A">$6,000,000</currency> more.</p>
         <p rend="center" xml:space="preserve"><space dim="vertical" extent="1" units="em"/>FARM LABOR AND THE DRAFT.<space dim="vertical" extent="1" units="em"/></p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The labor problem is one of great difficulty, and some of the best agencies of the Nation are addressing themselves to the task of solving it, so far as it is possible to solve it. Farmers have not been exempted from the draft. I know that they would not wish to be. I take it for granted they would not wish to be put in a class by themselves in this respect. But the attention of the War Department has been very seriously centered upon the task of interfering with the labor of the farms as little as possible, and under the new draft regulations I believe that the farmers of the country will find that their supply of labor is very much less seriously drawn upon than it was under the first and initial draft, made before we had our present full experience in these perplexing matters. The supply of labor in all industries is a matter we must look to and are looking to with diligent care.</p>
         <p rend="center" xml:space="preserve"><space dim="vertical" extent="1" units="em"/>RESPONSE OF THE FARMERS.<space dim="vertical" extent="1" units="em"/></p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">And let me say that the stimulation of the agencies I have enumerated has been responded to by the farmers in splendid fashion. I dare say that you are aware that the farmers of this country are as efficient as any other farmers in the world. They do not produce more per acre than the farmers in <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Europe</place>. It is not necessary that they should do so. It would perhaps be bad economy for them to attempt it. But they do produce by two to three or four times more per man, per unit of labor and capital, than the farmers of any European country. They are more alert and use more labor-saving devices than any other farmers in the world. And their response to the demands of the present emergency has been in every way remarkable. Last spring their planting exceeded by 12,000,000 acres the largest planting of any previous year, and the yields from the crops were record-breaking yields. In the fall of <date value="1917-99-99">1917</date> a wheat acreage of 42,170,000 was planted, which was 1,000,000 larger than for any preceding year, 3,000,000 greater than the next largest, and 7,000,000 greater than the preceding five-year average.</p>
         <p rend="center" xml:space="preserve"><space dim="vertical" extent="1" units="em"/>SHOULD EXCEED PAST ACHIEVEMENTS.<space dim="vertical" extent="1" units="em"/></p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">But I ought to say to you that it is not only necessary that these achievements should be repeated, but that they should be exceeded. I know what this advice involves. It involves not only labor but sacrifice, the painstaking application of every bit of scientific knowledge and every tested practice that is available. It means the utmost economy, even to the point where the pinch comes. It means the kind of concentration and self-sacrifice which is involved in the field of battle itself, where the object always looms greater than the individual. And yet the Government will help and help in every way that is possible. The impression which prevails in some quarters that while the Government has sought to fix the prices of foodstuffs it has not sought to fix other prices which determine the expenses of the farmer is a mistaken one. As a matter of fact, the Government has actively and successfully regulated the prices of many fundamental materials underlying all the industries of the country, and has regulated them, not only for the purchases of the Government, but also for the purchases of the general public, and I have every reason to believe that the Congress will extend the powers of the Government in this important and even essential matter, so that the tendency to profiteering, which is showing itself in too many quarters, may be effectively checked. In fixing the prices of foodstuffs the Government has sincerely tried to keep the interests of the farmer as much in mind as the interests of the communities which are to be served, but it is serving mankind as well as the farmer, and everything in these times of war takes on the rigid aspect of duty.</p>
         <p rend="center" xml:space="preserve"><space dim="vertical" extent="1" units="em"/>AMERICA’S GREATEST OPPORTUNITY.<space dim="vertical" extent="1" units="em"/></p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I will not appeal to you to continue and renew and increase your efforts. I do not believe that it is necessary to do so. I believe that you will do it without any word or appeal from me, because you understand as well as I do the needs and opportunities of this great hour when the fortunes of mankind everywhere seem about to be determined and when <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> has the greatest opportunity she has ever had to make good her own freedom and in making it good to lend a helping hand to men struggling for their freedom everywhere. You remember that it was farmers from whom came the first shots at <place reg="Lexington, MA" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Lexington</place>, that set aflame the revolution that made <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> free. I hope and believe that the farmers of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> will willingly and conspicuously stand by to win this war also.</p>
         <p rend="center" xml:space="preserve"><space dim="vertical" extent="1" units="em"/>GLAD WE ARE AMERICANS.<space dim="vertical" extent="1" units="em"/></p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The toil, the intelligence, the energy, the foresight, the self-sacrifice, and devotion of the farmers of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> will, I believe, bring to a triumphant conclusion this great last war for the emancipation of men from the control of arbitrary government and the selfishness of class legislation and control, and then, when the end has come, we may look each other in the face and be glad that we are Americans and have had the privilege to play such a part.</p>

         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve"><render as="smallcap" rend="inherit">Gentlemen of the Congress</render>: On the eighth of January I had the honor of <link refurl="4003457" link-pointer-type="RelatedDoc" rend="inherit"
                  xml:space="preserve">addressing you</link> on the objects of the war as our people conceive them. The <personRef refurl="x4004689" reg="David Lloyd George" link-pointer-type="person">Prime Minister</personRef> of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Great Britain</place> had spoken in similar terms on the <date value="1918-01-05">fifth of January</date>. To these addresses the <personRef link-pointer-type="person">German Chancellor</personRef> replied on the <date value="1918-01-24">twenty-fourth</date> and <person link-pointer-type="person">Count Czernin</person>, for <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Austria</place>, on the same day. It is gratifying to have our desire so promptly realized that all exchanges of view on this great matter should be made in the hearing of all world.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve"><person link-pointer-type="person">Count Czernin’s</person> reply, which is directed chiefly to <link refurl="4003457" link-pointer-type="RelatedDoc" rend="inherit"
                  xml:space="preserve">my own address of the eighth of January</link>, is uttered in a very friendly tone. He finds in my statement a sufficiently encouraging approach to the views of his own Government to justify him in believing that it furnishes a basis for a more detailed discussion of purposes by the two Governments. He is represented to have intimated that the views he was expressing had been communicated to me beforehand and that I was aware of them at the time he was uttering them; but in this I am sure he was misunderstood. I had received no intimation of what he intended to say. There was, of course, no reason why he should communicate privately with me. I am quite content to be one of his public audience.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve"><person reg="Georg von Hertling" link-pointer-type="person">Count von Hertling’s</person> reply is, I must say, very vague and very confusing. It is full of equivocal phrases and leads it is not clear where. But it is certainly in a very different tone from that of <person link-pointer-type="person">Count Czernin</person>, and apparently of an opposite purpose. It confirms, I am sorry to say, rather than removes, the unfortunate impression made by what we had learned of the conferences at <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Brest-Litovsk</place>. His discussion and acceptance of our general principles lead him to no practical conclusions. He refuses to apply them to the substantive items which must constitute the body of any final settlement. He is jealous of international action and of international counsel. He accepts, he says, the principle of public diplomacy, but he appears to insist that it be confined, at any rate in this case, to generalities and that the several particular questions of territory and sovereignty, the several questions upon whose settlement must depend the acceptance of peace by the twenty-three states now engaged in the war, must be discussed and settled, not in general council, but severally by the nations most immediately concerned by interest or neighborhood. He agrees that the seas should be free, but looks askance at any limitation to that freedom by international action in the interest of the common order. He would without reserve be glad to see economic barriers removed between nation and nation, for that could in no way impede the ambitions of the military party with whom he seems constrained to keep on terms. Neither does he raise objection to a limitation of armaments. That matter will be settled of itself, he thinks, by the economic conditions which must follow the war. But the German colonies, he demands, must be returned without debate. He will discuss with no one but the representatives of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Russia</place> what disposition shall be made of the peoples and the lands of the Baltic provinces; with no one but the Government of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">France</place> the “conditions” under which French territory shall be evacuated; and only with <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Austria</place> what shall be done with <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Poland</place>. In the determination of all questions affecting the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Balkan states</place> he defers, as I understand him, to <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Austria</place> and <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Turkey</place>; and with regard to the agreements to be entered into concerning the non-Turkish peoples of the present <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Ottoman Empire</place>, to the Turkish authorities themselves. After a settlement all around, effected in this fashion, by individual barter and concession, he would have no objection, if I correctly interpret his statement, to a league of nations which would undertake to hold the new balance of power steady against external disturbance.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">It must be evident to everyone who understands what this war has wrought in the opinion and temper of the world that no general peace, no peace worth the infinite sacrifices of these years of tragical suffering, can possibly be arrived at in any such fashion. The method the <personRef reg="Georg von Hertling" link-pointer-type="person">German Chancellor</personRef> proposes is the method of the Congress of <place reg="Vienna, Austria" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Vienna</place>. We cannot and will not return to that. What is at stake now is the peace of the world. What we are striving for is a new international order based upon broad and universal principles of right and justice,—no mere peace of shreds and patches. Is it possible that <person reg="Georg von Hertling" link-pointer-type="person">Count von Hertling</person> does not see that, does not grasp it, is in fact living in his thought in a world dead and gone? Has he utterly forgotten the Reichstag Resolutions of the <date value="1917-07-19">nineteenth of July</date>, or does he deliberately ignore them? They spoke of the conditions of a general peace, not of national aggrandizement or of arrangements between state and state. The peace of the world depends upon the just settlement of each of the several problems to which I adverted in <link refurl="4003457" link-pointer-type="RelatedDoc" rend="inherit"
                  xml:space="preserve">my recent address to the Congress</link>. I, of course, do not mean that the peace of the world depends upon the acceptance of any particular set of suggestions as to the way in which those problems are to be dealt with. I mean only that those problems each and all affect the whole world; that unless they are dealt with in a spirit of unselfish and unbiased justice, with a view to the wishes, the natural connections, the racial aspirations, the security, and the peace of mind of the peoples involved, no permanent peace will have been attained. They cannot be discussed separately or in corners. None of them constitutes a private or separate interest from which the opinion of the world may be shut out. Whatever affects the peace affects mankind, and nothing settled by military force, if settled wrong, is settled at all. It will presently have to be reopened.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Is <person reg="Georg von Hertling" link-pointer-type="person">Count von Hertling</person> not aware that he is speaking in the court of mankind, that all the awakened nations of the world now sit in judgment on what every public man, of whatever nation, may say on the issues of a conflict which has spread to every region of the world? The Reichstag Resolutions of July themselves frankly accepted the decisions of that court. There shall be no annexations, no contributions, no punitive damages. Peoples are not to be handed about from one sovereignty to another by an international conference or an understanding between rivals and antagonists. National aspirations must be respected; peoples may now be dominated and governed only by their own consent. “Self-determination” is not a mere phrase. It is an imperative principle of action, which statesmen will henceforth ignore at their peril. We cannot have general peace for the asking, or by the mere arrangements of a peace conference. It cannot be pieced together out of individual understandings between powerful states. All the parties to this war must join in the settlement of every issue anywhere involved in it; because what we are seeking is a peace that we can all unite to guarantee and maintain and every item of it must be submitted to the common judgment whether it be right and fair, and act of justice, rather than a bargain between sovereigns.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> has no desire to interfere in European affairs or to act as arbiter in European territorial disputes. She would disdain to take advantage of any internal weakness or disorder to impose her own will upon another people. She is quite ready to be shown that the settlements she has suggested are not the best or the most enduring. They are only her own provisional sketch of principles and of the way in which they should be applied. But she entered this war because she was made a partner, whether she would or not, in the sufferings and indignities inflicted by the military masters of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Germany</place>, against the peace and security of mankind; and the conditions of peace will touch her as nearly as they will touch any other nation to which is entrusted a leading part in the maintenance of civilization. She cannot see her way to peace until the causes of this war are removed, its renewal rendered as nearly as may be impossible.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">This war had its roots in the disregard of the rights of small nations and of nationalities which lacked the union and the force to make good their claim to determine their own allegiances and their own forms of political life. Covenants must now be entered into which will render such things impossible for the future; and those covenants must be backed by the united force of all the nations that love justice and are willing to maintain it at any cost. If territorial settlements and the political relations of great populations which have not the organized power to resist are to be determined by the contracts of the powerful governments which consider themselves most directly affected, as <person reg="Georg von Hertling" link-pointer-type="person">Count von Hertling</person> proposes, why may not economic questions also? It has come about in the altered world in which we now find ourselves that justice and the rights of peoples affect the whole field of international dealing as much as access to raw materials and fair and equal conditions of trade. <person reg="Georg von Hertling" link-pointer-type="person">Count von Hertling</person> wants the essential bases of commercial and industrial life to be safeguarded by common agreement and guarantee, but he cannot expect that to be conceded him if the other matters to be determined by the articles of peace are not handled in the same way as items in the final accounting. He cannot ask the benefit of common agreement in the one field without according it in the other. I take it for granted that he sees that separate and selfish compacts with regard to trade and the essential materials of manufacture would afford no foundation for peace. Neither, he may rest assured, will separate and selfish compacts with regard to provinces and peoples.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve"><person link-pointer-type="person">Count Czernin</person> seems to see the fundamental elements of peace with clear eyes and does not seek to obscure them. He sees that an independent <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Poland</place>, made up of all the indisputably Polish peoples who lie contiguous to one another, is a matter of European concern and must of course be conceded; that <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Belgium</place> must be evacuated and restored, no matter what sacrifices and concessions that may involve; and that national aspirations must be satisfied, even within his own Empire, in the common interest of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Europe</place> and mankind. If he is silent about questions which touch the interest and purpose of his allies more nearly than they touch those of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Austria</place> only, it must of course be because he feels constrained, I suppose, to defer to <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Germany</place> and <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Turkey</place> in the circumstances. Seeing and conceding, as he does, the essential principles involved and the necessity of candidly applying them, he naturally feels that <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Austria</place> can respond to the purpose of peace as expressed by the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> with less embarrassment than could <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Germany</place>. He would probably have gone much farther had it not been for the embarrassments of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Austria’s</place> alliances and of her dependence upon <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Germany</place>.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">After all, the test of whether it is possible for either government to go any further in this comparison of views is simple and obvious. The principles to be applied are these:</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">First, that each part of the final settlement must be based upon the essential justice of that particular case and upon such adjustments as are most likely to bring a peace that will be permanent;</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Second, that peoples and provinces are not to be bartered about from sovereignty to sovereignty as if they were mere chattels and pawns in a game, even the great game, now forever discredited, of the balance of power; but that</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Third, every territorial settlement involved in this war must be made in the interest and for the benefit of the populations concerned, and not as a part of any mere adjustment or compromise of claims amongst rival states; and</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Fourth, that all well defined national aspirations shall be accorded the utmost satisfaction that can be accorded them without introducing new or perpetuating old elements of discord and antagonism that would be likely in time to break the peace of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Europe</place> and consequently of the world.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">A general peace erected upon such foundations can be discussed. Until such a peace can be secured we have no choice but to go on. So far as we can judge, these principles that we regard as fundamental are already everywhere accepted as imperative except among the spokesmen of the military and annexationist party in <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Germany</place>. If they have anywhere else been rejected, the objectors have not been sufficiently numerous or influential to make their voices audible. The tragical circumstance is that this one party in <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Germany</place> is apparently willing and able to send millions of men to their death to prevent what all the world now sees to be just.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I would not be a true spokesman of the people of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> if I did not say once more that we entered this war upon no small occasion, and that we can never turn back from a course chosen upon principle. Our resources are in part mobilized now, and we shall not pause until they are mobilized in their entirety. Our armies are rapidly going to the fighting front, and will go more and more rapidly. Our whole strength will be put into this war of emancipation,—emancipation from the threat and attempted mastery of selfish groups of autocratic rulers,—whatever the difficulties and present partial delays. We are indomitable in our power of independent action and can in no circumstances consent to live in a world governed by intrigue and force. We believe that our own desire for a new international order under which reason and justice and the common interests of mankind shall prevail is the desire of enlightened men everywhere. Without that new order the world will be without peace and human life will lack tolerable conditions of existence and development. Having set our hand to the task of achieving it, we shall not turn back.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I hope that it is not necessary for me to add that no word of what I have said is intended as a threat. That is not the temper of our people. I have spoken thus only that the whole world may know the true spirit of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place>,—that men everywhere may know that our passion for justice and for self-government is no mere passion of words but a passion which, once set in action, must be satisfied. The power of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> is a menace to no nation or people. It will never be used in aggression or for the aggrandizement of any selfish interest of our own. It springs out of freedom and is for the service of freedom.</p>

         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve"><render as="smallcap" rend="inherit">Fellow Citizens</render>: This is the anniversary of our acceptance of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Germany’s</place> challenge to fight for our right to live and be free, and for the sacred rights of free men everywhere. The Nation is awake. There is no need to call to it. We know what the war must cost, our utmost sacrifice, the lives of our fittest men and, if need be, all that we possess. The loan we are met to discuss is one of the least parts of what we are called upon to give and to do, though in itself imperative. The people of the whole country are alive to the necessity of it, and are ready to lend to the utmost, even where it involves a sharp skimping and daily sacrifice to lend out of meagre earnings. They will look with reprobation and contempt upon those who can and will not, upon those who demand a higher rate of interest, upon those who think of it as a mere commercial transaction. I have not come, therefore, to urge the loan. I have come only to give you, if I can, a more vivid conception of what it is for.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The reasons for this great war, the reason why it had to come, the need to fight it through, and the issues that hang upon its outcome, are more clearly disclosed now than ever before. It is easy to see just what this particular loan means because the Cause we are fighting for stands more sharply revealed than at any previous crisis of the momentous struggle. The man who knows least can now see plainly how the cause of Justice stands and what the imperishable thing is he is asked to invest in. Men in <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> may be more sure than they ever were before that the cause is their own, and that, if it should be lost, their own great Nation’s place and mission in the world would be lost with it.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I call you to witness, my fellow countrymen, that at no stage of this terrible business have I judged the purposes of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Germany</place> intemperately. I should be ashamed in the presence of affairs so grave, so fraught with the destinies of mankind throughout all the world, to speak with truculence, to use the weak language of hatred or vindictive purpose. We must judge as we would be judged. I have sought to learn the objects <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Germany</place> has in this war from the mouths of her own spokesmen, and to deal as frankly with them as I wished them to deal with me. I have laid bare our own ideals, our own purposes, without reserve or doubtful phrase, and have asked them to say as plainly what it is that they seek.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">We have ourselves proposed no injustice, no aggression. We are ready, whenever the final reckoning is made, to be just to the German people, deal fairly with the German power, as with all others. There can be no difference between peoples in the final judgment, if it is indeed to be a righteous judgment. To propose anything but justice, even-handed and dispassionate justice, to <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Germany</place> at any time, whatever the outcome of the war, would be to renounce and <word altform="dishonor">dishonour</word> our own cause. For we ask nothing that we are not willing to accord.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">It has been with this thought that I have sought to learn from those who spoke for <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Germany</place> whether it was justice or dominion and the execution of their own will upon the other nations of the world that the German leaders were seeking. They have answered, answered in unmistakable terms. They have avowed that it was not justice but dominion and the unhindered execution of their own will.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The avowal has not come from Germany’s statesmen. It has come from her military leaders, who are her real rulers. Her statesmen have said that they wished peace, and were ready to discuss its terms whenever their opponents were willing to sit down at the conference table with them. <personRef reg="Georg von Hertling" link-pointer-type="person">Her present Chancellor</personRef> has said,—in indefinite and uncertain terms, indeed, and in phrases that often seem to deny their own meaning, but with as much plainness as he thought prudent,—that he believed that peace should be based upon the principles which we had declared would be our own in the final settlement. At <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Brest-Litovsk</place> her civilian delegates spoke in similar terms; professed their desire to conclude a fair peace and accord to the peoples with whose fortunes they were dealing the right to choose their own allegiances. But action accompanied and followed the profession. Their military masters, the men who act for <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Germany</place> and exhibit her purpose in execution, proclaimed a very different conclusion. We can not mistake what they have done,—in <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Russia</place>, in <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Finland</place>, in the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Ukraine</place>, in <place reg="Romania" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Rumania</place>. The real test of their justice and fair play has come. From this we may judge the rest. They are enjoying in <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Russia</place> a cheap triumph in which no brave or gallant nation can long take pride. A great people, helpless by their own act, lies for the time at their mercy. Their fair professions are forgotten. They nowhere set up justice, but everywhere impose their power and exploit everything for their own use and aggrandizement; and the peoples of conquered provinces are invited to be free under their dominion!</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Are we not justified in believing that they would do the same things at their western front if they were not there face to face with armies whom even their countless divisions can not overcome? If, when they have felt their check to be final, they should propose favourable and equitable terms with regard to <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Belgium</place> and <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">France</place> and <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Italy</place>, could they blame us if we concluded that they did so only to assure themselves of a free hand in <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Russia</place> and the East?</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Their purpose is undoubtedly to make all the Slavic peoples, all the free and ambitious nations of the Baltic peninsula, all the lands that <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Turkey</place> has dominated and misruled, subject to their will and ambition and build upon that dominion an empire of force upon which they fancy that they can then erect an empire of gain and commercial supremacy,—an empire as hostile to the Americas as to the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Europe</place> which it will overawe,—an empire which will ultimately master <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Persia</place>, <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">India</place>, and the peoples of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Far East</place>. In such a <word altform="program">programme</word> our ideals, the ideals of justice and humanity and liberty, the principle of the free self-determination of nations upon which all the modern world insists, can play no part. They are rejected for the ideals of power, for the principle that the strong must rule the weak, that trade must follow the flag, whether those to whom it is taken welcome it or not, that the peoples of the world are to be made subject to the patronage and overlordship of those who have the power to enforce it.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">That <word altform="program">programme</word> once carried out, <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> and all who care or dare to stand with her must arm and prepare themselves to contest the mastery of the World, a mastery in which the rights of common men, the rights of women and of all who are weak, must for the time being be trodden under foot and disregarded, and the old, agelong struggle for freedom and right begin again at its beginning Everything that <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> has lived for and loved and grown great to vindicate and bring to a glorious realization will have fallen in utter ruin and the gates of mercy once more pitilessly shut upon mankind!</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The thing is preposterous and impossible; and yet is not that what the whole course and action of the German armies has meant where-ever they have moved? I do not wish, even in this moment of utter disillusionment, to judge harshly or unrighteously. I judge only what the German arms have accomplished with unpitying thoroughness throughout every fair region they have touched.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">What, then, are we to do? For myself, I am ready, ready still, ready even now, to discuss a fair and just and honest peace at any time that it is sincerely purposed,—a peace in which the strong and the weak shall fare alike. But the answer, when I proposed such a peace, came from the German commanders in <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Russia</place>, and I cannot mistake the meaning of the answer.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I accept the challenge. I know that you accept it. All the world shall know that you accept it. It shall appear in the utter sacrifice and self-forgetfulness with which we shall give all that we love and all that we have to redeem the world and make it fit for free men like ourselves to live in. This now is the meaning of all that we do. Let everything that we say, my fellow countrymen, everything that we henceforth plan and accomplish, ring true to this response till the majesty and might of our concerted power shall fill the thought and utterly defeat the force of those who flout and misprize what we <word altform="honor">honour</word> and hold dear. <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Germany</place> has once more said that force, and force alone, shall decide whether Justice and peace shall reign in the affairs of men, whether Right as <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> conceives it or Dominion as she conceives it shall determine the destinies of mankind. There is, therefore, but one response possible from us: Force, Force to the utmost, Force without stint or limit, the righteous and triumphant Force which shall make Right the law of the world, and cast every selfish dominion down in the dust.</p>

         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Mr. <render as="smallcap" rend="inherit">Chairman and fellow countrymen</render>: I should be very sorry to think that <person link-pointer-type="person">Mr. Davison</person> in any degree curtailed his exceedingly interesting speech for fear that he was postponing mine, because I am sure you listened with the same intent and intimate interest with which I listened to the extraordinarily vivid account he gave of the things which he had realized because he had come in contact with them on the other side of the water. We compassed them with our imagination. He compassed them in his personal experience.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I am not come here <word altform="tonight">to-night</word> to review for you the work of the <name type="org">Red Cross</name>. I am not competent to do so, because I have not had the time or the opportunity to follow it in detail. I have come here simply to say a few words to you as to what it all seems to me to mean.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">It means a great deal. There are two duties with which we are face to face. The first duty is to win the war. The second duty, that goes hand in hand with it, is to win it greatly and worthily, showing the real quality of our power not only, but the real quality of our purpose and of ourselves. Of course, the first duty, the duty that we must keep in the foreground of our thought until it is accomplished, is to win the war. I have heard gentlemen recently say that we must get five million men ready. Why limit it to five million? I have asked the Congress of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> to name no limit, because the Congress intends, I am sure, as we all intend, that every ship that can carry men or supplies shall go laden upon every voyage with every man and every supply she can carry.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">And we are not to be diverted from the grim purpose of winning the war by any insincere approaches upon the subject of peace. I can say with a clear conscience that I have tested those intimations and have found them insincere. I now recognize them for what they are, an opportunity to have a free hand, particularly in the East, to carry out purposes of conquest and exploitation. Every proposal with regard to accommodation in the West involves a reservation with regard to the East. Now, so far as I am concerned, I intend to stand by <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Russia</place> as well as <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">France</place>. The helpless and the friendless are the very ones that need friends and succor, and if any man in <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Germany</place> thinks we are going to sacrifice anybody for our own sake, I tell them now they are mistaken. For the glory of this war, my fellow-citizens, so far as we are concerned, is that it is, perhaps for the first time in history, an unselfish war. I could not be proud to fight for a selfish purpose, but I can be proud to fight for mankind. If they wish peace, let them come forward through accredited representatives and lay their terms on the table. We have laid ours, and they know what they are.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">But behind all this grim purpose, my friends, lies the opportunity to demonstrate not only force, which will be demonstrated to the utmost, but the opportunity to demonstrate character, and it is that opportunity that we have most conspicuously in the work of the <name type="person">Red Cross</name>. Not that our men in arms do not represent our character, for they do, and it is a character which those who see and realize appreciate and admire, but their duty is the duty of force. The duty of the <name type="person">Red Cross</name> is the duty of mercy and succor and friendship.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Have you formed a picture in your imagination of what this war is doing for us and for the world? In my own mind I am convinced that not a hundred years of peace could have knitted this Nation together as this single year of war has knitted it together; and better even than that, if possible, it is knitting the world together. Look at the picture! In the center of the scene, four nations engaged against the world, and at every point of vantage, showing that they are seeking selfish aggrandizement; and against them, twenty-three governments, representing the greater part of the population of the world, drawn together into a new sense of community of interest, a new sense of community of purpose, a new sense of unity of life. The <personRef refurl="x4000737" reg="Newton D. Baker" link-pointer-type="person">Secretary of War</personRef> told me an interesting incident the other day. He said when he was in <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Italy</place> a member of the Italian Government was explaining to him the many reasons why <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Italy</place> felt near to the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place>. He said, “If you want to try an interesting experiment, go up to any one of these troop trains and ask in English how many of them have been in <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place>, and see what happens.” He tried the experiment. He went up to a troop train and he asked, “How many of you boys have been in <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place>,” and he said it seemed to him as if half of them sprang up: “Me from San Francisco,” “Me from New York,”—all over. There was part of the heart of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> in the Italian Army,—people that had been knitted to us by association, who knew us, who had lived amongst us, who had worked shoulder to shoulder with us, and now, friends of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place>, were fighting for their native <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Italy</place>.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Friendship is the only cement that will ever hold the world together. And this intimate contact of the great <name type="org">Red Cross</name> with the peoples who are suffering the terrors and deprivations of this war is going to be one of the greatest instrumentalities of friendship that the world ever knew; and the center of the heart of it all, if we sustain it properly, will be this land that we so dearly love.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">My friends, a great day of duty has come, and duty finds a man’s soul as no kind of work can ever find it. May I say this: The duty that faces us all now is to serve one another. No man can afford to make a fortune out of this war. There are men amongst us who have forgotten that, if they ever saw it. Some of you are old enough—I am old enough—to remember men who made fortunes out of the Civil War, and you know how they were regarded by their fellow citizens. That was a war to save one country. This is a war to save the world. And your relation to the <name type="org">Red Cross</name> is one of the relations which will relieve you of the stigma. You cannot give anything to the Government of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place>. It will not accept it. There is a law of Congress against accepting even services without pay. The only thing that the Government will accept is a loan and duties performed, but it is a great deal better to give than to lend or to pay, and your great channel for giving is the <name type="org">American Red Cross</name>. Down in your hearts you can not take very much satisfaction in the last analysis in lending money to the Government of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place>, because the interest which you draw will burn your pockets. It is a commercial transaction; and some men have even dared to cavil at the rate of interest, not knowing the incidental commentary that that constitutes upon their attitude.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">But when you give, something of your heart, something of your soul, something of yourself goes with the gift, particularly when it is given in such form that it never can come back by way of direct benefit to yourself. You know there is the old cynical definition of gratitude, as “the lively expectation of favors to come.” Well, there is no expectation of favors to come in this kind of giving. These things are bestowed in order that the world may be a fitter place to live in, that men may be succored, that homes may be restored, that suffering may be relieved, that the face of the earth may have the blight of destruction removed from it, and that wherever force goes, there shall go mercy and helpfulness.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">And when you give, give absolutely all that you can spare, and do not consider yourself liberal in the giving. If you give with self-adulation, you are not giving at all, you are giving to your own vanity, but if you give until it hurts, then your heart-blood goes into it.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Think what we have here! We call it the <name type="org">American Red Cross</name>, but it is merely a branch of a great international organization which is not only recognized by the statutes of each of the civilized governments of the world, but is recognized by international agreement and treaty, as the recognized and accepted instrumentality of mercy and succor. And one of the deepest stains that rest upon the reputation of the German Army is that they have not respected the <name type="org">Red Cross</name>. That goes to the root of the matter. They have not respected the instrumentality they themselves participated in setting up as the thing which no man was to touch because it was the expression of common humanity. By being members of the <name type="org">American Red Cross</name>, we are members of a great fraternity and comradeship which extends all over the world. This cross which these ladies bore to-day is an emblem of Christianity itself.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">It fills my imagination, ladies and gentlemen, to think of the women all over this country who are busy to-night, and are busy every night and every day, doing the work of the <name type="org">Red Cross</name>, busy with a great eagerness to find out the most serviceable thing to do, busy with a forgetfulness of all the old frivolities of their social relationships, ready to curtail the duties of the household in order that they may contribute to this common work that all their hearts are engaged in and in doing which their hearts become acquainted with each other. When you think of this, you realize how the people of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> are being drawn together into a great intimate family whose heart is being used for the service of the soldiers not only, but for the service of civilians where they suffer and are lost in a maze of distresses and distractions.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">You have, then, this noble picture of justice and mercy as the two servants of liberty. For only where men are free do they think the thoughts of comradeship, only where they are free do they think the thoughts of sympathy, only where they are free are they mutually helpful, only where they are free do they realize their dependence upon one another and their comradeship in a common interest and common necessity. If you ladies and gentlemen could read some of the touching despatches which come through official channels, for even through those channels there come voices of humanity that are infinitely pathetic; if you could catch some of those voices that speak the utter longing of oppressed and helpless peoples all over the world to hear something like the Battle Hymn of the Republic, to hear the feet of the great hosts of Liberty coming to set them free, to set their minds free, set their lives free, set their children free; you would know what comes into the heart of those who are trying to contribute all the brains and power they have to this great enterprise of Liberty. I summon you to the comradeship. I summon you in this next week to say how much and how sincerely and how unanimously you sustain the heart of the world.</p>

         <p rend="center" xml:space="preserve"><space dim="vertical" extent="1" units="em"/>_________<space dim="vertical" extent="1" units="em"/></p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve"><render as="smallcap" rend="inherit">Gentlemen of the Congress</render>: It is with unaffected reluctance that I come to ask you to prolong your session long enough to provide more adequate resources for the Treasury for the conduct of the war. I have reason to appreciate as fully as you do how arduous the session has been. Your <word altform="labors">labours</word> have been severe and protracted. You have passed a long series of measures which required the debate of many doubtful questions of judgment and many exceedingly difficult questions of principle as well as of practice. The summer is upon us in which <word altform="labor">labour</word> and counsel are twice arduous and are constantly apt to be impaired by lassitude and fatigue. The elections are at hand and we ought as soon as possible to go and render an intimate account of our trusteeship to the people who delegated us to act for them in the weighty and anxious matters that crowd upon us in these days of critical choice and action. But we dare not go to the elections until we have done our duty to the full. These are days when duty stands stark and naked and even with closed eyes we know it is there. Excuses are unavailing. We have either done our duty or we have not. The fact will be as gross and plain as the duty itself. In such a case lassitude and fatigue seem negligible enough. The facts are tonic and suffice to freshen the <word altform="labor">labour</word>.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">And the facts are these: Additional revenues must manifestly be provided for. It would be a most unsound policy to raise too large a proportion of them by loan, and it is evident that the four billions now provided for by taxation will not of themselves sustain the greatly enlarged budget to which we must immediately look forward. We cannot in fairness wait until the end of the fiscal year is at hand to apprise our people of the taxes they must pay on their earnings of the present calendar year, whose accountings and expenditures will then be closed. We cannot get increased taxes unless the country knows what they are to be and practices the necessary economy to make them available. Definiteness, early definiteness, as to what its tasks are to be is absolutely necessary for the successful administration of the Treasury: it cannot frame fair and workable regulations in haste; and it must frame its regulations in haste if it is not to know its exact task until the very eve of its performance. The present tax laws are marred, moreover, by inequities which ought to be remedied. Indisputable facts, every one; and we cannot alter or blink them. To state them is argument enough.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">And yet perhaps you will permit me to dwell for a moment upon the situation they disclose. Enormous loans freely spent in the stimulation of industry of almost every sort produce inflations and extravagances which presently make the whole economic structure questionable and insecure and the very basis of credit is cut away. Only fair, equitably distributed taxation, of the widest incidence and drawing chiefly from the sources which would be likely to demoralize credit by their very abundance, can prevent inflation and keep our industrial system free of speculation and waste. We shall naturally turn, therefore, I suppose, to war profits and incomes and luxuries for the additional taxes. But the war profits and incomes upon which the increased taxes will be levied will be the profits and incomes of the calendar year <date value="1918-99-99">1918</date>. It would be manifestly unfair to wait until the early months of <date value="1919-99-99">1919</date> to say what they are to be. It might be difficult, I should imagine, to run the mill with water that had already gone over the wheel.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Moreover, taxes of that sort will not be paid until the June of next year, and the Treasury must anticipate them. It must use the money they are to produce before it is due. It must sell short time certificates of indebtedness. In the autumn a much larger sale of long time bonds must be effected than has yet been attempted. What are the bankers to think of the certificates if they do not certainly know where the money is to come from which is to take them up? And how are investors to approach the purchase of bonds with any sort of confidence or knowledge of their own affairs if they do not know what taxes they are to pay and what economies and adjustments of their business they must effect? I cannot assure the country of a successful administration of the Treasury in <date value="1918-99-99">1918</date> if the question of further taxation is to be left undecided until <date value="1919-99-99">1919</date>.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The consideration that dominates every other now, and makes every other seem trivial and negligible, is the winning of the war. We are not only in the midst of the war, we are at the very peak and crisis of it. Hundreds of thousands of our men, carrying our hearts with them and our fortunes, are in the field, and ships are crowding faster and faster to the ports of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">France</place> and <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">England</place> with regiment after regiment, thousand after thousand, to join them until the enemy shall be beaten and brought to a reckoning with mankind. There can be no pause or intermission. The great enterprise must, on the contrary, be pushed with greater and greater energy. The volume of our might must steadily and rapidly be augmented until there can be no question of resisting it. If that is to be accomplished, gentlemen, money must sustain it to the utmost. Our financial <word altform="program">programme</word> must no more be left in doubt or suffered to lag than our ordnance <word altform="program">programme</word> or our ship <word altform="program">programme</word> or our munitions <word altform="program">programme</word> or our <word altform="program">programme</word> for making millions of men ready. These others are not <word altform="programs">programmes</word>, indeed, but mere plans upon paper, unless there is to be an unquestionable supply of money.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">That is the situation, and it is the situation which creates the duty, no choice or preference of ours. There is only one way to meet that duty. We must meet it without selfishness or fear of consequences. Politics is adjourned. The elections will go to those who think least of it; to those who go to the constituencies without explanations or excuses, with a plain record of duty faithfully and disinterestedly performed. I, for one, am always confident that the people of this country will give a just verdict upon the service of the men who act for them when the facts are such that no man can disguise or conceal them. There is no danger of deceit now. An intense and pitiless light beats upon every man and every action in this tragic plot of war that is now upon the stage. If lobbyists hurry to <place reg="Washington, DC" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Washington</place> to attempt to turn what you do in the matter of taxation to their protection or advantage, the light will beat also upon them. There is abundant fuel for the light in the records of the Treasury with regard to profits of every sort. The profiteering that cannot be got at by the restraints of conscience and love of country can be got at by taxation. There is such profiteering now and the information with regard to it is available and indisputable.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I am advising you to act upon this matter of taxation now, gentlemen, not because I do not know that you can see and interpret the facts and the duty they impose just as well and with as clear a perception of the obligations involved as I can, but because there is a certain solemn satisfaction in sharing with you the responsibilities of such a time. The world never stood in such case before. Men never before had so clear or so moving a vision of duty. I know that you will begrudge the work to be done here by us no more than the men begrudge us theirs who lie in the trenches and sally forth to their death. There is a stimulating comradeship knitting us all together. And this task to which I invite your immediate consideration will be performed under favourable influences if we will look to what the country is thinking and expecting and care nothing at all for what is being said and believed in the lobbies of <place reg="Washington, DC" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Washington</place> hotels, where the atmosphere seems to make it possible to believe what is believed nowhere else.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Have you not felt the spirit of the nation rise and its thought become a single and common thought since these eventful days came in which we have been sending our boys to the other side? I think you must read that thought, as I do, to mean this, that the people of this country are not only united in the resolute purpose to win this war but are ready and willing to bear any burden and undergo any sacrifice that it may be necessary for them to bear in order to win it. We need not be afraid to tax them, if we lay taxes justly. They know that the war must be paid for and that it is they who must pay for it, and if the burden is justly distributed and the sacrifice made a common sacrifice from which none escapes who can bear it at all, they will carry it cheerfully and with a sort of solemn pride. I have always been proud to be an American, and was never more proud than now, when all that we have said and all that we have foreseen about our people is coming true. The great days have come when the only thing that they ask for or admire is duty greatly and adequately done; when their only wish for <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> is that she may share the freedom she enjoys; when a great, compelling sympathy wells up in their hearts for men everywhere who suffer and are oppressed; and when they see at last the high uses for which their wealth has been piled up and their mighty power accumulated and, counting neither blood nor treasure now that their final day of opportunity has come, rejoice to spend and to be spent through a long night of suffering and terror in order that they and men everywhere may see the dawn of a day of righteousness and justice and peace. Shall we grow weary when they bid us act?</p>

         <H4>ADDRESS.</H4>
         <p rend="center" xml:space="preserve"><space dim="vertical" extent="1" units="em"/>_________<space dim="vertical" extent="1" units="em"/></p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve"><render as="smallcap" rend="inherit">Gentlemen of the Diplomatic Corps and My Fellow Citizens</render>: I am happy to draw apart with you to this quiet place of old counsel in order to speak a little of the meaning of this day of our nation’s independence. The place seems very still and remote. It is as serene and untouched by the hurry of the world as it was in those great days long ago when <person refurl="x4000491" reg="George Washington" link-pointer-type="person">General Washington</person> was here and held leisurely conference with the men who were to be associated with him in the creation of a nation. From these gentle slopes they looked out upon the world and saw it whole, saw it with the light of the future upon it, saw it with modern eyes that turned away from a past which men of liberated spirits could no longer endure. It is for that reason that we cannot feel, even here, in the immediate presence of this sacred tomb, that this is a place of death. It was a place of achievement. A great promise that was meant for all mankind was here given plan and reality. The associations by which we are here surrounded are the inspiriting associations of that noble death which is only a glorious consummation. From this green hillside we also ought to be able to see with comprehending eyes the world that lies about us and should conceive anew the purposes that must set men free.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">It is significant,—significant of their own character and purpose and of the influences they were setting afoot,—that <person refurl="x4000491" reg="George Washington" link-pointer-type="person">Washington</person> and his associates, like the barons at <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Runnymede</place>, spoke and acted, not for a class, but for a people. It has been left for us to see to it that it shall be understood that they spoke and acted, not for a single people only, but for all mankind. They were thinking, not of themselves and of the material interests which <word altform="centered">centred</word> in the little groups of landholders and merchants and men of affairs with whom they were accustomed to act, in <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Virginia</place> and the colonies to the north and south of her, but of a people which wished to be done with classes and special interests and the authority of men whom they had not themselves chosen to rule over them. They entertained no private purpose, desired no peculiar privilege. They were consciously planning that men of every class should be free and <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> a place to which men out of every nation might resort who wished to share with them the rights and privileges of free men. And we take our cue from them,—do we not? We intend what they intended. We here in <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> believe our participation in this present war to be only the fruitage of what they planted. Our case differs from theirs only in this, that it is our inestimable privilege to concert with men out of every nation what shall make not only the liberties of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> secure but the liberties of every other people as well. We are happy in the thought that we are permitted to do what they would have done had they been in our place. There must now be settled once for all what was settled for <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> in the great age upon whose inspiration we draw to-day. This is surely a fitting place from which calmly to look out upon our task, that we may fortify our spirits for its accomplishment. And this is the appropriate place from which to avow, alike to the friends who look on and to the friends with whom we have the happiness to be associated in action, the faith and purpose with which we act.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">This, then, is our conception of the great struggle in which we are engaged. The plot is written plain upon every scene and every act of the supreme tragedy. On the one hand stand the peoples of the world,—not only the peoples actually engaged, but many others also who suffer under mastery but cannot act; peoples of many races and in every part of the world,—the people of stricken <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Russia</place> still, among the rest, though they are for the moment unorganized and helpless. Opposed to them, masters of many armies, stand an isolated, friendless group of governments who speak no common purpose but only selfish ambitions of their own by which none can profit but themselves, and whose peoples are fuel in their hands; governments which fear their people and yet are for the time their sovereign lords, making every choice for them and disposing of their lives and fortunes as they will, as well as of the lives and fortunes of every people who fall under their power,—governments clothed with the strange trappings and the primitive authority of an age that is altogether alien and hostile to our own. The Past and the Present are in deadly grapple and the peoples of the world are being done to death between them.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">There can be but one issue. The settlement must be final. There can be no compromise. No halfway decision would be tolerable. No halfway decision is conceivable. These are the ends for which the associated peoples of the world are fighting and which must be conceded them before there can be peace:</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I. The destruction of every arbitrary power anywhere that can separately, secretly, and of its single choice disturb the peace of the world; or, if it cannot be presently destroyed, at the least its reduction to virtual impotence.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">II. The settlement of every question, whether of territory, of sovereignty, of economic arrangement, or of political relationship, upon the basis of the free acceptance of that settlement by the people immediately concerned, and not upon the basis of the material interest or advantage of any other nation or people which may desire a different settlement for the sake of its own exterior influence or mastery.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">III. The consent of all nations to be governed in their conduct towards each other by the same principles of honour and of respect for the common law of civilized society that govern the individual citizens of all modern states in their relations with one another; to the end that all promises and covenants may be sacredly observed, no private plots or conspiracies hatched, no selfish injuries wrought with impunity, and a mutual trust established upon the handsome foundation of a mutual respect for right.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">IV. The establishment of an organization of peace which shall make it certain that the combined power of free nations will check every invasion of right and serve to make peace and justice the more secure by affording a definite tribunal of opinion to which all must submit and by which every international readjustment that cannot be amicably agreed upon by the peoples directly concerned shall be sanctioned.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">These great objects can be put into a single sentence. What we seek is the reign of law, based upon the consent of the governed and sustained by the organized opinion of mankind.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">These great ends can not be achieved by debating and seeking to reconcile and accommodate what statesmen may wish, with their projects for balances of power and of national opportunity. They can be realized only by the determination of what the thinking peoples of the world desire, with their longing hope for justice and for social freedom and opportunity.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I can fancy that the air of this place carries the accents of such principles with a peculiar kindness. Here were started forces which the great nation against which they were primarily directed at first regarded as a revolt against its rightful authority but which it has long since seen to have been a step in the liberation of its own people as well as of the people of the United States; and I stand here now to speak,—speak proudly and with confident hope,—of the spread of this revolt, this liberation, to the great stage of the world itself! The blinded rulers of <place reg="Germany" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Prussia</place> have roused forces they knew little of,—forces which, once roused, can never be crushed to earth again; for they have at their heart an inspiration and a purpose which are deathless and of the very stuff of triumph!</p>

         <p rend="noindent" xml:space="preserve"><render as="smallcap" rend="inherit">My Fellow Citizens:</render></p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I am not here to promote the loan. That will be done,—ably and enthusiastically done,—by the hundreds of thousands of loyal and tireless men and women who have undertaken to present it to you and to our fellow citizens throughout the country; and I have not the least doubt of their complete success; for I know their spirit and the spirit of the country. My confidence is confirmed, too, by the thoughtful and experienced cooperation of the bankers here and everywhere, who are lending their invaluable aid and guidance. I have come, rather, to seek an opportunity to present to you some thoughts which I trust will serve to give you, in perhaps fuller measure than before, a vivid sense of the great issues involved, in order that you may appreciate and accept with added enthusiasm the grave significance of the duty of supporting the Government by your men and your means to the utmost point of sacrifice and self-denial. No man or woman who has really taken in what this war means can hesitate to give to the very limit of what they have; and it is my mission here <word altform="tonight">to-night</word> to try to make it clear once more what the war really means. You will need no other stimulation or reminder of your duty.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">At every turn of the war we gain a fresh consciousness of what we mean to accomplish by it. When our hope and expectation are most excited we think more definitely than before of the issues that hang upon it and of the purposes which must be realized by means of it. For it has positive and well defined purposes which we did not determine and which we cannot alter. No statesman or assembly created them; no statesman or assembly can alter them. They have arisen out of the very nature and circumstances of the war. The most that statesmen or assemblies can do is to carry them out or be false to them. They were perhaps not clear at the outset; but they are clear now. The war has lasted more than four years and the whole world has been drawn into it. The common will of mankind has been substituted for the particular purposes of individual states. Individual statesmen may have started the conflict, but neither they nor their opponents can stop it as they please. It has become a peoples’ war, and peoples of all sorts and races, of every degree of power and variety of fortune, are involved in its sweeping processes of change and settlement. We came into it when its character had become fully defined and it was plain that no nation could stand apart or be indifferent to its outcome. Its challenge drove to the heart of everything we cared for and lived for. The voice of the war had become clear and gripped our hearts. Our brothers from many lands, as well as our own murdered dead under the sea, were calling to use, and we responded, fiercely and of course.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The air was clear about us. We saw things in their full, convincing proportions as they were; and we have seen them with steady eyes and unchanging comprehension ever since. We accepted the issues of the war as facts, not as any group of men either here or elsewhere had defined them, and we can accept no outcome which does not squarely meet and settle them. Those issues are these:</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Shall the military power of any nation or group of nations be suffered to determine the fortunes of peoples over whom they have no right to rule except the right of force?</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Shall strong nations be free to wrong weak nations and make them subject to their purpose and interest?</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Shall peoples be ruled and dominated, even in their own internal affairs, by arbitrary and irresponsible force or by their own will and choice?</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Shall there be a common standard of right and privilege for all peoples and nations or shall the strong do as they will and the weak suffer without redress?</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Shall the assertion of right be haphazard and by casual alliance or shall there be a common concert to oblige the observance of common rights?</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">No man, no group of men, chose these to be the issues of the struggle. They <render rend="inherit" as="italic">are</render> the issues of it; and they must be settled,—by no arrangement or compromise or adjustment of interests, but definitely and once for all and with a full and unequivocal acceptance of the principle that the interest of the weakest is as sacred as the interest of the strongest.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">This is what we mean when we speak of a permanent peace, if we speak sincerely, intelligently, and with a real knowledge and comprehension of the matter we deal with.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">We are all agreed that there can be no peace obtained by any kind of bargain or compromise with the governments of the Central Empires, because we have dealt with them already and have seen them deal with other governments that were parties to this struggle, at <place reg="Brest-Litovsk, Russia (Belarus)" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Brest-Litovsk</place> and <place reg="Bucharest, Hungary" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Bucharest</place>. They have convinced us that they are without <word altform="honor">honour</word> and do not intend justice. They observe no covenants, accept no principle but force and their own interest. We cannot “come to terms” with them. They have made it impossible. The German people must by this time be fully aware that we cannot accept the word of those who forced this war upon us. We do not think the same thoughts or speak the same language of agreement.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">It is of capital importance that we should also be explicitly agreed that no peace shall be obtained by any kind of compromise or abatement of the principles we have avowed as the principles for which we are fighting. There should exist no doubt about that. I am, therefore, going to take the liberty of speaking with the utmost frankness about the practical implications that are involved in it.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">If it be in deed and in truth the common object of the governments associated against <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Germany</place> and of the nations whom they govern, as I believe it to be, to achieve by the coming settlements a secure and lasting peace, it will be necessary that all who sit down at the peace table shall come ready and willing to pay the price, the only price, that will procure it; and ready and willing, also, to create in some virile fashion the only instrumentality by which it can be made certain that the agreements of the peace will be <word altform="honored">honoured</word> and fulfilled.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">That price is impartial justice in every item of the settlement, no matter whose interest is crossed; and not only impartial justice but also the satisfaction of the several peoples whose fortunes are dealt with. That indispensable instrumentality is a League of Nations formed under covenants that will be efficacious. Without such an instrumentality, by which the peace of the world can be guaranteed, peace will rest in part upon the word of outlaws and only upon that word. For <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Germany</place> will have to redeem her character, not by what happens at the peace table but by what follows.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">And, as I see it, the constitution of that League of Nations and the clear definition of its objects must be a part, is in a sense the most essential part, of the peace settlement itself. It cannot be formed now. If formed now, it would be merely a new alliance confined to the nations associated against a common enemy. It is not likely that it could be formed after the settlement. It is necessary to guarantee the peace; and the peace cannot be guaranteed as an afterthought. The reason, to speak in plain terms again, why it must be guaranteed is that there will be parties to the peace whose promises have proved untrustworthy, and means must be found in connection with the peace settlement itself to remove that source of insecurity. It would be folly to leave the guarantee to the subsequent voluntary action of the governments we have seen destroy <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Russia</place> and deceive <place reg="Romania" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Roumania</place>.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">But these general terms do not disclose the whole matter. Some details are needed to make them sound less like a thesis and more like a practical <word altform="program">programme</word>. These, then, are some of the particulars, and I state them with the greater confidence because I can state them authoritatively as representing this Government’s interpretation of its own duty with regard to peace:</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">First, the impartial justice meted out must involve no discrimination between those to whom we wish to be just and those to whom we do not wish to be just. It must be a justice that plays no <word altform="favorites">favourites</word> and knows no standard but the equal rights of the several peoples concerned;</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Second, no special or separate interest of any single nation or any group of nations can be made the basis of any part of the settlement which is not consistent with the common interest of all;</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Third, there can be no leagues or alliances or special covenants and understandings within the general and common family of the League of Nations;</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Fourth, and more specifically, there can be no special, selfish economic combinations within the League and no employment of any form of economic boycott or exclusion except as the power of economic penalty by exclusion from the markets of the world may be vested in the League of Nations itself as a means of discipline and control.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Fifth, all international agreements and treaties of every kind must be made known in their entirety to the rest of the world.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Special alliances and economic rivalries and hostilities have been the prolific sources in the modern world of the plans and passions that produce war. It would be an insincere as well as an insecure peace that did not exclude them in definite and binding terms.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The confidence with which I venture to speak for our people in these matters does not spring from our traditions merely and the well known principles of international action which we have always professed and followed. In the same sentence in which I say that the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> will enter into no special arrangments or understandings with particular nations let me say also that the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> is prepared to assume its full share of responsibility for the maintenance of the common covenants and understandings upon which peace must henceforth rest. We still read <person refurl="x4000491" reg="George Washington" link-pointer-type="person">Washington’s</person> immortal warning against “entangling alliances” with full comprehension and an answering purpose. But only special and limited alliances entangle; and we recognize and accept the duty of a new day in which we are permitted to hope for a general alliance which will avoid entanglements and clear the air of the world for common understandings and the maintenance of common rights.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I have made this analysis of the international situation which the war has created, not, of course, because I doubted whether the leaders of the great nations and peoples with whom we are associated were of the same mind and entertained a like purpose, but because the air every now and again gets darkened by mists and groundless doubtings and mischievous perversions of counsel and it is necessary once and again to sweep all the irresopnsible talk about peace intrigues and weakening morale and doubtful purpose on the part of those in authority utterly, and if need be unceremoniously, aside and say things in the plainest words that can be found, even when it is only to say over again what has been said before, quite as plainly as if in less <sic corr="unvarnished">unvernished</sic> terms.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">As I have said, neither I nor any other man in governmental authority created or gave form to the issues of this war. I have simply responded to them with such vision as I could command. But I have responded gladly and with a resolution that has grown warmer and more confident as the issues have grown clearer and clearer. It is now plain that they are issues which no man can pervert unless it be wilfully.  I am bound to fight for them, and happy to fight for them as time and circumstance have revealed them to me as to all the world. Our enthusiasm for them grows more and more irresistable as they stand out in more and more vivid and unmistakable outline.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">And the forces that fight for them draw into closer and closer array, organize their millions into more and more unconquerable might, as they become more and more distinct to the thought and purpose of the peoples engaged. It is the peculiarity of this great war that while statesmen have seemed to cast about for definitions of their purpose and have sometimes seemed to shift their ground and their point of view, the thought of the mass of men, whom statesmen are supposed to instruct and lead, has grown more and more unclouded, more and more certain of what it is that they are fighting for. National purposes have fallen more and more into the background and the common purpose of enlightened mankind has taken their place. The counsels of plain men have become on all hands more simple and straightforward and more unified than the counsels of sophisticated men of affairs, who still retain the impression that they are playing a game of power and playing for high stakes. That is why I have said that this is a people’s war, not a statesmen’s. Statesmen must follow the clarifed common thought or be broken.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I take that to be the significance of the fact that assemblies and associations of many kinds made up of plain workaday people have demanded, almost every time they came together, and are still demanding, that the leaders of their governments declare to them plainly what it is, exactly what it is, that they were seeking in this war, and what they think the items of the final settlement should be. They are not yet satisfied with what they have been told. They still seem to fear that they are getting what they ask for only in statesmen’s terms,—only in the terms of territorial arrangements and divisions of power, and not in terms of broad-visioned justice and mercy and peace and the satisfaction of those deepseated longings of oppressed and distracted men and women and enslaved peoples that seem to them the only things worth fighting a war for that engulfs the world. Perhaps statesmen have not always recognized this changed aspect of the whole world of policy and action. Perhaps they have not always spoken in direct reply to the questions asked because they did not know how searching those questions were and what sort of answers they demanded.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">But I, for one, am glad to attempt the answer again and again, in the hope that I may make it clearer and clearer that my one thought is to satisfy those who struggle in the ranks and are, perhaps above all others, entitled to a reply whose meaning no one can have any excuse for misunderstanding, if he understands the language in which it is spoken or can get someone to translate it correctly into his own. And I believe that the leaders of the governments with which we are associated will speak, as they have occasion, as plainly as I have tried to speak. I hope that they will feel free to say whether they think that I am in any degree mistaken in my interpretation of the issues involved or in my purpose with regard to the means by which a satisfactory settlement of those issues may be obtained. Unity of purpose and of counsel are as imperatively necessary in this war as was unity of command in the battlefield; and with perfect unity of purpose and counsel will come assurance of complete victory. It can be had in no other way. “Peace drives” can be effectively neutralized and silenced only by showing that every victory of the nations associated against <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Germany</place> brings the nations nearer the sort of peace which will bring security and reassurance to all peoples and make the recurrence of another such struggle of pitiless force and bloodshed forever impossible, and that nothing else can. <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Germany</place> is constantly intimating the “terms” she will accept; and always finds that the world does not want terms. It wishes the final triumph of justice and fair dealing.</p>

         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve"><render as="smallcap" rend="inherit">Gentlemen of the Senate</render>: The unusual circumstances of a world war in which we stand and are judged in the view not only of our own people and our own consciences but also in the view of all nations and peoples will, I hope, justify in your thought, as it does in mine, the message I have come to bring you. I regard the concurrence of the Senate in the constitutional amendment proposing the extension of the suffrage to women as vitally essential to the successful prosecution of the great war of humanity in which we are engaged. I have come to urge upon you the considerations which have led me to that conclusion. It is not only my privilege, it is also my duty to apprise you of every circumstance and element involved in this momentous struggle which seems to me to affect its very processes and its outcome. It is my duty to win the war and to ask you to remove every obstacle that stands in the way of winning it.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I had assumed that the Senate would concur in the amendment because no disputable principle is involved but only a question of the method by which the suffrage is to be extended to women. There is and can be no party issue involved in it. Both of our great national parties are pledged, explicitly pledged, to equality of suffrage for the women of the country. Neither party, therefore, it seems to me, can justify hesitation as to the method of obtaining it, can rightfully hesitate to substitute federal initiative for state initiative, if the early adoption of this measure is necessary to the successful prosecution of the war and if the method of state action proposed in the party platforms of <date value="1916-99-99">1916</date> is impracticable within any reasonable length of time, if practicable at all. And its adoption is, in my judgment, clearly necessary to the successful prosecution of the war and the successful realization of the objects for which the war is being fought.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">That judgment I take the liberty of urging upon you with solemn earnestness for reasons which I shall state very frankly and which I shall hope will seem as conclusive to you as they seem to me.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">This is a peoples’ war and the peoples’ thinking constitutes its atmosphere and morale, not the predilections of the drawing room or the political considerations of the caucus. If we be indeed democrats and wish to lead the world to democracy, we can ask other peoples to accept in proof of our sincerity and our ability to lead them whither they wish to be led nothing less persuasive and convincing than our actions. Our professions will not suffice. Verification must be forthcoming when verification is asked for. And in this case verification is asked for,—asked for in this particular matter. You ask by whom? Not through diplomatic channels; not by Foreign Ministers. Not by the intimations of parliaments. It is asked for by the anxious, expectant, suffering peoples with whom we are dealing and who are willing to put their destinies in some measure in our hands, if they are sure that we wish the same things that they do. I do not speak by conjecture. It is not alone the voices of statesmen and of newspapers that reach me, and the voices of foolish and intemperate agitators do not reach me at all. Through many, many channels I have been made aware what the plain, struggling, workaday folk are thinking upon whom the chief terror and suffering of this tragic war falls. They are looking to the great, powerful, famous <placeRef reg="United States" link-pointer-type="place">Democracy of the West</placeRef> to lead them to the new day for which they have so long waited; and they think, in their logical simplicity, that democracy means that women shall play their part in affairs alongside men and upon an equal footing with them. If we reject measures like this, in ignorance or defiance of what a new age has brought forth, of what they have seen but we have not, they will cease to believe in us; they will cease to follow or to trust us. They have seen their own governments accept this interpretation of democracy,—seen old governments like that of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Great Britain</place>, which did not profess to be democratic, promise readily and as of course this justice to women, though they had before refused it, the strange revelations of this war having made many things new and plain, to governments as well as to peoples.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Are we alone to refuse to learn the lesson? Are we alone to ask and take the utmost that our women can give,—service and sacrifice of every kind,—and still say we do not see what title that gives them to stand by our sides in the guidance of the affairs of their nation and ours? We have made partners of the women in this war; shall we admit them only to a partnership of suffering and sacrifice and toil and not to a partnership of privilege and right? This war could not have been fought, either by the other nations engaged or by <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place>, if it had not been for the services of the women,—services rendered in every sphere,—not merely in the fields of effort in which we have been accustomed to see them work, but wherever men have worked and upon the very skirts and edges of the battle itself. We shall not only be distrusted but shall deserve to be distrusted if we do not enfranchise them with the fullest possible enfranchisement, as it is now certain that the other great free nations will enfranchise them. We cannot isolate our thought and action in such a matter from the thought of the rest of the world. We must either conform or deliberately reject what they propose and resign the leadership of liberal minds to others.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The women of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> are too noble and too intelligent and too devoted to be slackers whether you give or withhold this thing that is mere justice; but I know the magic it will work in their thoughts and spirits if you give it them. I propose it as I would propose to admit soldiers to the suffrage, the men fighting in the field for our liberties and the liberties of the world, were they excluded. The tasks of the women lie at the very heart of the war, and I know how much stronger that heart will beat if you do this just thing and show our women that you trust them as much as you in fact and of necessity depend upon them.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Have I said that the passage of this amendment is a vitally necessary war measure, and do you need further proof? Do you stand in need of the trust of other peoples and of the trust of our own women? Is that trust an asset or is it not? I tell you plainly, as the commander-in-chief of our armies and of the gallant men in our fleets, as the present spokesman of this people in our dealings with the men and women throughout the world who are now our partners, as the responsible head of a great government which stands and is questioned day by day as to its purposes, its principles, its hopes, whether they be serviceable to men everywhere or only to itself, and who must himself answer these questionings or be shamed, as the guide and director of forces caught in the grip of war and by the same token in need of every material and spiritual resource this great nation possesses,—I tell you plainly that this measure which I urge upon you is vital to the winning of the war and to the energies alike of preparation and of battle.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">And not to the winning of the war only. It is vital to the right solution of the great problems which we must settle, and settle immediately, when the war is over. We shall need then in our vision of affairs, as we have never needed them before, the sympathy and insight and clear moral instinct of the women of the world. The problems of that time will strike to the roots of many things that we have not hitherto questioned, and I for one believe that our safety in those questioning days, as well as our comprehension of matters that touch society to the quick, will depend upon the direct and authoritative participation of women in our counsels. We shall need their moral sense to preserve what is right and fine and worthy in our system of life as well as to discover just what it is that ought to be purified and reformed. Without their counsellings we shall be only half wise.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">That is my case. This is my appeal. Many may deny its validity, if they choose, but no one can brush aside or answer the arguments upon which it is based. The executive tasks of this war rest upon me. I ask that you lighten them and place in my hands instruments, spiritual instruments, which I do not now possess, which I sorely need, and which I have daily to <word altform="apologize">apologise</word> for not being able to employ.</p>

         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The war thus comes to an end; for, having accepted these terms of armistice, it will be impossible for the German command to renew it.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">It is not now possible to assess the consequences of this great consummation. We know only that this tragical war, whose consuming flames swept from one nation to another until all the world was on fire, is at an end and that it was the privilege of our own people to enter it at its most critical juncture in such fashion and in such force as to contribute in a way of which we are all deeply proud to the great result. We know, too, that the object of the war is attained; the object upon which all free men had set their hearts; and attained with a sweeping completeness which even now we do not realize. Armed imperialism such as the men conceived who were but yesterday the masters of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Germany</place> is at an end, its illicit ambitions engulfed in black disaster. Who will now seek to revive it? The arbitrary power of the military caster of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Germany</place> which once could secretly and of its own single choice disturb the peace of the world is discredited and destroyed. And more than that,—much more than that,—has been accomplished. The great nations which associated themselves to destroy it have now definitely united in the common purpose to set up such a peace as will satisfy the longing of the whole world for disinterested justice, embodied in settlements which are based upon something much better and much more lasting than the selfish competitive interests of powerful states. There is no longer conjecture as to the objects the victors have in mind. They have a mind in the matter, not only, but a heart also. Their avowed and concerted purpose is to satisfy and protect the weak as well as to accord their just rights to the strong.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The humane temper and intention of the victorious governments has already been manifested in a very practical way. Their representatives in the Supreme War Council at <place reg="Versailles, France" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Versailles</place> have by unanimous resolution assured the peoples of the Central Empires that everything that is possible in the circumstances will be done to supply them with food and relieve the distressing want that is in so many places threatening their very lives; and steps are to be taken immediately to organize these efforts at relief in the same systematic manner that they were organized in the case of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Belgium</place>. By the use of the idle tonnage of the Central Empires it ought presently to be possible to lift the fear of utter misery from their oppressed populations and set their minds and energies free for the great and hazardous tasks of political reconstruction which now face them on every hand. Hunger does not breed reform; it breeds madness and all the ugly distempers that make an ordered life impossible.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">For with the fall of the ancient governments which rested like an incubus upon the peoples of the Central Empires has come political change not merely, but revolution; and revolution which seems as yet to assume no final and ordered form but to run from one fluid change to another, until thoughtful men are forced to ask themselves, With what governments, and of what sort, are we about to deal in the making of the covenants of peace? With what authority will they meet us, and with what assurance that their authority will abide and sustain securely the international arrangements into which we are about to enter? There is here matter for no small anxiety and misgiving. When peace is made, upon whose promises and engagements besides our own is it to rest?</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Let us be perfectly frank with ourselves and admit that these questions cannot be satisfactorily answered now or at once. But the moral is not that there is little hope of an early answer that will suffice. It is only that we must be patient and helpful and mindful above all of the great hope and confidence that lie at the heart of what is taking place. Excesses accomplish nothing. Unhappy <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Russia</place> has furnished abundant recent proof of that. Disorder immediately defeats itself. If excesses should occur, if disorder should for a time raise its head, a sober second thought will follow and a day of constructive action, if we help and do not hinder.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The present and all that it holds belongs to the nations and the peoples who preserve their self-control and the orderly processes of their governments; the future to those who prove themselves the true friends of mankind. To conquer with arms is to make only a temporary conquest; to conquer the world by earning its esteem is to make permanent conquest. I am confident that the nations that have learned the discipline of freedom and that have settled with self-possession to its ordered practice are now about to make conquest of the world by the sheer power of example and of friendly helpfulness.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The peoples who have but just come out from under the yoke of arbitrary government and who are now coming at last into their freedom will never find the treasures of liberty they are in search of if they look for them by the light of the torch. They will find that every pathway that is stained with the blood of their own brothers leads to the wilderness, not to the seat of their hope. They are now face to face with their initial test. We must hold the light steady until they find themselves. And in the meantime, if it be possible, we must establish a peace that will justly define their place among the nations, remove all fear of their neighbours and of their former masters, and enable them to live in security and contentment when they have set their own affairs in order. I, for one, do not doubt their purpose or their capacity. There are some happy signs that they know and will choose the way of self-control and peaceful accommodation. If they do, we shall put our aid at their disposal in every way that we can. If they do not, we must await with patience and sympathy the awakening and recovery that will assuredly come at last.</p>

         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve"><render as="smallcap" rend="inherit">Gentlemen of the Congress</render>: The year that has elapsed since I last stood before you to fulfil my constitutional duty to give to the Congress from time to time information on the state of the Union has been so crowded with great events, great processes, and great results that I cannot hope to give you an adequate picture of its transactions or of the far-reaching changes which have been wrought in the life of our nation and of the world. You have yourselves witnessed these things, as I have. It is too soon to assess them; and we who stand in the midst of them and are part of them are less qualified than men of another generation will be to say what they mean, or even what they have been. But some great outstanding facts are unmistakable and constitute, in a sense, part of the public business with which it is our duty to deal. To state them is to set the stage for the legislative and executive action which must grow out of them and which we have yet to shape and determine.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">A year ago we had sent 145,918 men overseas. Since then we have sent 1,950,513, an average of 162,542 each month, the number in fact rising, in May last to 245,951, in June to 278,760, in July to 307,182, and continuing to reach similar figures in August and September,—in August 289,570 and in September 257,438. No such movement of troops ever took place before, across three thousand miles of sea, followed by adequate equipment and supplies, and carried safely through extraordinary dangers of attack,—dangers which were alike strange and infinitely difficult to guard against. In all this movement only seven hundred and fifty-eight men were lost by enemy attack,—six hundred and thirty of whom were upon a single English transport which was sunk near the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Orkney Islands</place>.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I need not tell you what lay back of this great movement of men and material. It is not invidious to say that back of it lay a supporting organization of the industries of the country and of all its productive activities more complete, more thorough in method and effective in result, more spirited and unanimous in purpose and effort than any other great belligerent had been able to effect. We profited greatly by the experience of the nations which had already been engaged for nearly three years in the the exigent and exacting business, their every resource and every executive proficiency taxed to the utmost. We were their pupils. But we learned quickly and acted with a promptness and a readiness of cooperation that justify our great pride that we were able to serve the world with unparalleled energy and quick accomplishment.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">But it is not the physical scale and executive efficiency of preparation, supply, equipment and despatch that I would dwell upon, but the mettle and quality of the officers and men we sent over and of the sailors who kept the seas, and the spirit of the nation that stood behind them. No soldiers or sailors ever proved themselves more quickly ready for the test of battle or acquitted themselves with more splendid courage and achievement when put to the test. Those of us who played some part in directing the great processes by which the war was pushed irresistibly forward to the final triumph may now forget all that and delight our thoughts with the story of what our men did. Their officers understood the grim and exacting task they had undertaken and performed it with an audacity, efficiency, and unhesitating courage that touch the story of convoy and battle with imperishable distinction at every turn, whether the enterprise were great or small,—from their great chiefs, <person refurl="x4005076" reg="John J. Pershing" link-pointer-type="person">Pershing</person> and <person refurl="x4000424" reg="William S. Sims" link-pointer-type="person">Sims</person>, down to the youngest lieutenant; and their men were worthy of them,—such men as hardly need to be commanded, and go to their terrible adventure blithely and with the quick intelligence of those who know just what it is they would accomplish. I am proud to be the fellow-countryman of men of such stuff and <word altform="valor">valour</word>. Those of us who stayed at home did our duty; the war could not have been won or the gallant men who fought it given their opportunity to win it otherwise; but for many a long day we shall think ourselves “accurs’d we were not there, and hold our manhoods cheap while any speaks that fought” with these at <place reg="St. Mihiel, France" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">St. Mihiel</place> or <place reg="Chateu Thierry, France" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Thierry</place>. The memory of those days of triumphant battle will go with these fortunate men to their graves; and each will have his <word altform="favorite">favourite</word> memory. “Old men forget; yet all shall be forgot, but he’ll remember with advantages what feats he did that day!”</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">What we all thank God for with deepest gratitude is that our men went in force into the line of battle just at the critical moment when the whole fate of the world seemed to hang in the balance and threw their fresh strength into the ranks of freedom in time to turn the whole tide and sweep of the fateful struggle,—turn it once for all, so that thenceforth it was back, back, back for their enemies, always back, never again forward! After that it was only a scant four months before the commanders of the Central Empires knew themselves beaten; and now their very empires are in liquidation!</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">And throughout it all how fine the spirit of the nation was: what unity of purpose, what untiring zeal! What elevation of purpose ran through all its splendid display of strength, its untiring accomplishment. I have said that those of us who stayed at home to do the work of organization and supply will always wish that we had been with the men whom we sustained by our <word altform="labor">labour</word>; but we can never be ashamed. It has been an inspiring thing to be here in the midst of fine men who had turned aside from every private interest of their own and devoted the whole of their trained capacity to the tasks that supplied the sinews of the whole great undertaking! The patriotism, the unselfishness, the thoroughgoing devotion and distinguished capacity that marked their toilsome <word altform="labors">labours</word>, day after day, month after month, have made them fit mates and comrades of the men in the trenches and on the sea. And not the men here in <place reg="Washington, DC" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Washington</place> only. They have but directed the vast achievement. Throughout innumerable factories, upon innumerable farms, in the depths of coal mines and iron mines and copper mines, wherever the stuffs of industry were to be obtained and prepared, in the shipyards, on the railways, at the docks, on the sea, in every <word altform="labor">labour</word> that was needed to sustain the battle lines, men have vied with each other to do their part and do it well. They can look any man-at-arms in the face, and say, We also strove to win and gave the best that was in us to make our fleets and armies sure of their triumph!</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">And what shall we say of the women,—of their instant intelligence, quickening every task that they touched; their capacity for organization and cooperation, which gave their action discipline and enhanced the effectiveness of everything they attempted; their aptitude at tasks to which they had never before set their hands; their utter self-sacrifice alike in what they did and in what they gave? Their contribution to the great result is beyond appraisal. They have added a new lustre to the annals of American womanhood.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The least tribute we can pay them is to make them the equals of men in political rights as they have proved themselves their equals in every field of practical work they have entered, whether for themselves or for their country. These great days of completed achievement would be sadly marred were we to omit that act of justice. Besides the immense practical services they have rendered, the women of the country have been the moving spirits in the systematic economies by which our people have voluntarily assisted to supply the suffering peoples of the world and the armies upon every front with food and everything else that we had that might serve the common cause. The details of such a story can never be fully written, but we carry them at our hearts and thank God that we can say that we are the kinsmen of such.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">And now we are sure of the great triumph for which every sacrifice was made. It has come, come in its completeness, and with the pride and inspiration of these days of achievement quick within us we turn to the tasks of peace again,—a peace secure against the violence of irresponsible monarchs and ambitious military coteries and made ready for a new order, for new foundations of justice and fair dealing.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">We are about to give order and organization to this peace not only for ourselves but for the other peoples of the world as well, so far as they will suffer us to serve them. It is international justice that we seek, not domestic safety merely. Our thoughts have dwelt of late upon <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Europe</place>, upon <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Asia</place>, upon the near and the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">far East</place>, very little upon the acts of peace and accommodation that wait to be performed at our own doors. While we are adjusting our relations with the rest of the world is it not of capital importance that we should clear away all grounds of misunderstanding with our immediate neighbors and give proof of the friendship we really feel? I hope that the members of the Senate will permit me to speak once more of the unratified treaty of friendship and adjustment with the Republic of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Colombia</place>. I very earnestly urge upon them an early and favorable action upon that vital matter. I believe that they will feel, with me, that the stage of affairs is now set for such action as will be not only just but generous and in the spirit of the new age upon which we have so happily entered.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">So far as our domestic affairs are concerned the problem of our return to peace is a problem of economic and industrial readjustment. That problem is less serious for us than it may turn out to be for the nations which have suffered the disarrangements and the losses of war longer than we. Our people, moreover, do not wait to be coached and led. They know their own business, are quick and resourceful at every readjustment, definite in purpose, and self-reliant in action. Any leading strings we might seek to put them in would speedily become hopelessly tangled because they would pay no attention to them and go their own way. All that we can do as their legislative and executive servants is to mediate the process of change here, there, and elsewhere as we may. I have heard much counsel as to the plans that should be formed and personally conducted to a happy consummation, but from no quarter have I seen any general scheme of “reconstruction” emerge which I thought it likely we could force our spirited business men and self-reliant <word altform="laborers">labourers</word> to accept with due pliancy and obedience.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">While the war lasted we set up many agencies by which to direct the industries of the country in the services it was necessary for them to render, by which to make sure of an abundant supply of the materials needed, by which to check undertakings that could for the time be dispensed with and stimulate those that were most serviceable in war, by which to gain for the purchasing departments of the Government a certain control over the prices of essential articles and materials, by which to restrain trade with alien enemies, make the most of the available shipping, and systematize financial transactions, both public and private, so that there would be no unnecessary conflict or confusion,—by which, in short, to put every material energy of the country in harness to draw the common load and make of us one team in the accomplishment of a great task. But the moment we knew the armistice to have been signed we took the harness off. Raw materials upon which the Government had kept its hand for fear there should not be enough for the industries that supplied the armies have been released and put into the general market again. Great industrial plants whose whole output and machinery had been taken over for the uses of the Government have been set free to return to the uses to which they were put before the war. It has not been possible to remove so readily or so quickly the control of foodstuffs and of shipping, because the world has still to be fed from our graneries and the ships are still needed to send supplies to our men oversea and to bring the men back as fast as the disturbed conditions on the other side of the water permit; but even there restraints are being relaxed as much as possible and more and more as the weeks go by.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Never before have there been agencies in existence in this country which knew so much of the field of supply, of <word altform="labor">labour</word>, and of industry as the War Industries Board, the War Trade Board, the Labour Department, the Food Administration, and the Fuel Administration have known since their <word altform="labors">labours</word> became thoroughly systematized; and they have not been isolated agencies; they have been directed by men which represented the permanent Departments of the Government and so have been the <word altform="centers">centres</word> of unified and cooperative action. It has been the policy of the Executive, therefore, since the armistice was assured (which is in effect a complete submission of the enemy) to put the knowledge of these bodies at the disposal of the business men of the country and to offer their intelligent mediation at every point and in every matter where it was desired. It is surprising how fast the process of return to a peace footing has moved in the three weeks since the fighting stopped. It promises to outrun any inquiry that may be instituted and any aid that may be offered. It will not be easy to direct it any better than it will direct itself. The American business man is of quick initiative.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The ordinary and normal processes of private initiative will not, however, provide immediate employment for all of the men of our returning armies. Those who are of trained capacity, those who are skilled workmen, those who have acquired familiarity with established businesses, those who are ready and willing to go to the farms, all those whose aptitudes are known or will be sought out by employers will find no difficulty, it is safe to say, in finding place and employment. But there will be others who will be at a loss where to gain a livelihood unless pains are taken to guide them and put them in the way of work. There will be a large floating residuum of <word altform="labor">labour</word> which should not be left wholly to shift for itself. It seems to me important, therefore, that the development of public works of every sort should be promptly resumed, in order that opportunities should be created for unskilled <word altform="labor">labour</word> in particular, and that plans should be made for such developments of our unused lands and our natural resources as we have hitherto lacked stimulation to undertake.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I particularly direct your attention to the very practical plans which the <personRef refurl="x4005191" reg="Franklin K. Lane" link-pointer-type="person">Secretary of the Interior</personRef> has developed in his annual report and before your Committees for the reclamation of arid, swamp, and cut-over lands which might, if the States were willing and able to cooperate, redeem some three hundred million acres of land for cultivation. There are said to be fifteen or twenty million acres of land in the West, at present arid, for whose reclamation water is available, if properly conserved. There are about two hundred and thirty million acres from which the forests have been cut but which have never yet been cleared for the plow and which lie waste and desolate. These lie scattered all over the Union. And there are nearly eighty million acres of land that lie under swamps or subject to periodical overflow or too wet for anything but grazing which it is perfectly feasible to drain and protect and redeem. The Congress can at once direct thousands of the returning soldiers to the reclamation of the arid lands which it has already undertaken, if it will but enlarge the plans and the appropriations which it has entrusted to the Department of the Interior. It is possible in dealing with our unused land to effect a great rural and agricultural development which will afford the best sort of opportunity to men who want to help themselves; and the <personRef refurl="x4005191" reg="Franklin K. Lane" link-pointer-type="person">Secretary of the Interior</personRef> has thought the possible methods out in a way which is worthy of your most friendly attention.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I have spoken of the control which must yet for a while, perhaps for a long while, be exercised over shipping because of the priority of service to which our forces overseas are entitled and which should also be accorded the shipments which are to save recently liberated peoples from starvation and many devasted regions from permanent ruin. May I not say a special word about the needs of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Belgium</place> and northern <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">France</place>? No sums of money paid by way of indemnity will serve of themselves to save them from hopeless disadvantage for years to come. Something more must be done than merely find the money. If they had money and raw materials in abundance to-morrow they could not resume their place in the industry of the world to-morrow,—the very important place they held before the flame of war swept across them. Many of their factories are razed to the ground. Much of their machinery is destroyed or has been taken away. Their people are scattered and many of their best workmen are dead. Their markets will be taken by others, if they are not in some special way assisted to rebuild their factories and replace their lost instruments of manufacture. They should not be left to the vicissitudes of the sharp competition for materials and for industrial facilities which is now to set in. I hope, therefore, that the Congress will not be unwilling, if it should become necessary, to grant to some such agency as the War Trade Board the right to establish priorities of export and supply for the benefit of these people whom we have been so happy to assist in saving from the German terror and whom we must not now thoughtlessly leave to shift for themselves in a pitiless competitive market.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">For the steadying and facilitation of our own domestic business readjustments nothing is more important than the immediate determination of the taxes that are to be levied for <date value="1918-99-99">1918</date>, <date value="1919-99-99">1919</date>, and <date value="1920-99-99">1920</date>. As much of the burden of taxation must be lifted from business as sound methods of financing the Government will permit, and those who conduct the great essential industries of the country must be told as exactly as possible what obligations to the Government they will be expected to meet in the years immediately ahead of them. It will be of serious consequence to the country to delay removing all uncertainties in this matter a single day longer than the right processes of debate justify. It is idle to talk of successful and confident business reconstruction before those uncertainties are resolved.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">If the war had continued it would have been necessary to raise at least eight billion dollars by taxation payable in the year <date value="1919-99-99">1919</date>; but the war has ended and I agree with the <personRef refurl="x4002290" reg="Carter Glass" link-pointer-type="person">Secretary of the Treasury</personRef> that it will be safe to reduce the amount to six billions. An immediate rapid decline in the expenses of the Government is not to be looked for. Contracts made for war supplies will, indeed, be rapidly cancelled and liquidated, but their immediate liquidation will make heavy drains on the Treasury for the months just ahead of us. The maintenance of our forces on the other side of the sea is still necessary. A considerable proportion of those forces must remain in <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Europe</place> during the period of occupation, and those which are brought home will be transported and demobilized at heavy expense for months to come. The interest on our war debt must of course be paid and provision made for the retirement of the obligations of the Government which represent it. But these demands will of course fall much below what a continuation of military operations would have entailed and six billions should suffice to supply a sound foundation for the financial operations of the year.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I entirely concur with the <personRef refurl="x4002290" reg="Carter Glass" link-pointer-type="person">Secretary of the Treasury</personRef> in recommending that the two billions needed in addition to the four billions provided by existing law be obtained from the profits which have accrued and shall accrue from war contracts and distinctively war business, but that these taxes be confined to the war profits accruing in <date value="1918-99-99">1918</date>, or in <date value="1919-99-99">1919</date> from business originating in war contracts. I urge your acceptance of his recommendation that provision be made now, not subsequently, that the taxes to be paid in <date value="1920-99-99">1920</date> should be reduced from six to four billions. Any arrangements less definite than these would add elements of doubt and confusion to the critical period of industrial readjustment through which the country must now immediately pass, and which no true friend of the nation’s essential business interests can afford to be responsible for creating or prolonging. Clearly determined conditions, clearly and simply charted, are indispensable to the economic revival and rapid industrial development which may confidently be expected if we act now and sweep all interrogation points away.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I take it for granted that the Congress will carry out the naval <word altform="program">programme</word> which was undertaken before we entered the war. The <personRef refurl="x4005046" reg="Josephus Daniels" link-pointer-type="person">Secretary of the Navy</personRef> has submitted to your Committees for authorization that part of the <word altform="program">programme</word> which covers the building plans of the next three years. These plans have been prepared along the lines and in accordance with the policy which the Congress established, not under the exceptional conditions of the war, but with the intention of adhering to a definite method of development for the navy. I earnestly recommend the uninterrupted pursuit of that policy. It would clearly be unwise for us to attempt to adjust our <word altform="programs">programmes</word> to a future world policy as yet undetermined.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The question which causes me the greatest concern is the question of the policy to be adopted towards the railroads. I frankly turn to you for counsel upon it. I have no confident judgment of my own. I do not see how any thoughtful man can have who knows anything of the complexity of the problem. It is a problem which must be studied, studied immediately, and studied without bias or prejudice. Nothing can be gained by becoming partisans of any particular plan of settlement.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">It was necessary that the administration of the railways should be taken over by the Government so long as the war lasted. It would have been impossible otherwise to establish and carry through under a single direction the necessary priorities of shipment. It would have been impossible otherwise to combine maximum production at the factories and mines and farms with the maximum possible car supply to take the products to the ports and markets; impossible to route troop shipments and freight shipments without regard to the advantage or disadvantage of the roads employed; impossible to subordinate, when necessary, all questions of convenience to the public necessity; impossible to give the necessary financial support to the roads from the public treasury. But all these necessities have now been served, and the question is, what is best for the railroads and for the public in the future.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Exceptional circumstances and exceptional methods of administration were not needed to convince us that the railroads were not equal to the immense tasks of transportation imposed upon them by the rapid and continuous development of the industries of the country. We knew that already. And we knew that they were unequal to it partly because their full cooperation was rendered impossible by law and their competition made obligatory, so that it has been impossible to assign to them severally the traffic which could best be carried by their respective lines in the interest of expedition and national economy.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">We may hope, I believe, for the formal conclusion of the war by treaty by the time Spring has come. The twenty-one months to which the present control of the railways is limited after formal proclamation of peace shall have been made will run at the farthest, I take it for granted, only to the <date value="1921-01-99">January of 1921</date>. The full equipment of the railways which the federal administration had planned could not be completed within any such period. The present law does not permit the use of the revenues of the several roads for the execution of such plans except by formal contract with their directors, some of whom will consent while some will not, and therefore does not afford sufficient authority to undertake improvements upon the scale upon which it would be necessary to undertake them. Every approach to this difficult subject-matter of decision brings us face to face, therefore, with this unanswered question: What is it right that we should do with the railroads, in the interest of the public and in fairness to their owners?</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Let me say at once that I have no answer ready. The only thing that is perfectly clear to me is that it is not fair either to the public or to the owners of the railroads to leave the question unanswered and that it will presently become my duty to relinquish control of the roads, even before the expiration of the statutory period, unless there should appear some clear prospect in the mean time of a legislative solution. Their release would at least produce one element of a solution, namely certainty and a quick stimulation of private initiative.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I believe that it will be serviceable for me to set forth as explicitly as possible the alternative courses that lie open to our choice. We can simply release the roads and go back to the old conditions of private management, unrestricted competition, and multiform regulation by both state and federal authorities; or we can go to the opposite extreme and establish complete government control, accompanied, if necessary, by actual government ownership; or we can adopt an intermediate course of modified private control, under a more unified and affirmative public regulation and under such alterations of the law as will permit wasteful competition to be avoided and a considerable degree of unification of administration to be effected, as, for example, by regional corporations under which the railways of definable areas would be in effect combined in single systems.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The one conclusion that I am ready to state with confidence is that it would be a disservice alike to the country and to the owners of the railroads to return to the old conditions unmodified. Those are conditions of restraint without development. There is nothing affirmative or helpful about them. What the country chiefly needs is that all its means of transportation should be developed, its railways, its waterways, its highways, and its countryside roads. Some new element of policy, therefore, is absolutely necessary,—necessary for the service of the public, necessary for the release of credit to those who are administering the railways, necessary for the protection of their security holders. The old policy may be changed much or little, but surely it cannot wisely be left as it was. I hope that the Congress will have a complete and impartial study of the whole problem instituted at once and prosecuted as rapidly as possible. I stand ready and anxious to release the roads from the present control and I must do so at a very early date if by waiting until the statutory limit of time is reached I shall be merely prolonging the period of doubt and uncertainty which is hurtful to every interest concerned.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I welcome this occasion to announce to the Congress my purpose to join in <place reg="Paris, France" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Paris</place> the representatives of the governments with which we have been associated in the war against the Central Empires for the purpose of discussing with them the main features of the treaty of peace. I realize the great inconveniences that will attend my leaving the country, particularly at this time, but the conclusion that it was my paramount duty to go has been forced upon me by considerations which I hope will seem as conclusive to you as they have seemed to me.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The allied governments have accepted the bases of peace which I outlined to the Congress on the <date value="1918-01-08">eighth of January last</date>, as the Central Empires also have, and very reasonably desire my personal counsel in their interpretation and application, and it is highly desirable that I should give it in order that the sincere desire of our Government to contribute without selfish purpose of any kind to settlements that will be of common benefit to all the nations concerned may be made fully manifest. The peace settlements which are now to be agreed upon are of transcendent importance both to us and to the rest of the world, and I know of no business or interest which should take precedence of them. The gallant men of our armed forces on land and sea have consciously fought for the ideals which they knew to be the ideals of their country; I have sought to express those ideals; they have accepted my statements of them as the substance of their own thought and purpose, as the associated governments have accepted them; I owe it to them to see to it, so far as in me lies, that no false or mistaken interpretation is put upon them, and no possible effort omitted to realize them. It is now my duty to play my full part in making good what they offered their life’s blood to obtain. I can think of no call to service which could transcend this.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I shall be in close touch with you and with affairs on this side the water, and you will know all that I do. At my request, the French and English governments have absolutely removed the censorship of cable news which until within a fortnight they had maintained and there is now no censorship whatever exercised at this end except upon attempted trade communications with enemy countries. It has been necessary to keep an open wire constantly available between <place reg="Paris, France" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Paris</place> and the Department of State and another between <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">France</place> and the Department of War. In order that this might be done with the least possible interference with the other uses of the cables, I have temporarily taken over the control of both cables in order that they may be used as a single system. I did so at the advice of the most experienced cable officials, and I hope that the results will justify my hope that the news of the next few months may pass with the utmost freedom and with the least possible delay from each side of the sea to the other.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">May I not hope, Gentlemen of the Congress, that in the delicate tasks I shall have to perform on the other side of the sea, in my efforts truly and faithfully to interpret the principles and purposes of the country we love, I may have the encouragement and the added strength of your united support? I realize the magnitude and difficulty of the duty I am undertaking; I am poignantly aware of its grave responsibilities. I am the servant of the nation. I can have no private thought or purpose of my own in performing such an errand. I go to give the best that is in me to the common settlements which I must now assist in arriving at in conference with the other working heads of the associated governments. I shall count upon your friendly countenance and encouragement. I shall not be inaccessible. The cables and the wireless will render me available for any counsel or service you may desire of me, and I shall be happy in the thought that I am constantly in touch with the weighty matters of domestic policy with which we shall have to deal. I shall make my absence as brief as possible and shall hope to return with the happy assurance that it has been possible to translate into action the great ideals for which <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> has striven.</p>

We lisped our love of freedom in the writings of your great pioneers long before the Revolution in either country. The very Declaration of Independence which notified the world of the birth of a new state in the family of nations, was largely paraphrased from French conceptions of freedom and sovereignty.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">And when the Revolution in <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> was won, and the struggle to throw off monarchical institutions was still engulfing <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">France</place>, it was the courageous sympathy of our leaders with the aspirations of your people which sowed the seed for a friendship which shall continue in perennial bloom, its harvest still ungarnered.</p>

         <p rend="noindent" xml:space="preserve"> <render as="smallcap" rend="inherit">Mr. President, Mr. Recteur:</render> </p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I feel very keenly the distinguished honor which has been conferred upon me by the great <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">University of Paris</place>, and it is very delightful to me also to have the honor of being inducted into the great company of scholars whose life and fame have made the history of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">University of Paris</place> a thing admired among men of cultivation in all parts of the world.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">By what you have said, sir, of the theory of education which has been followed in <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">France</place>, and which I have tried to promote in the <place reg="America" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place>, I am tempted to venture upon a favorite theme. I have always thought, sir, that the chief object of education was to awaken the spirit, and that inasmuch as literature whenever it touched its great and higher notes was an expression of the spirit of mankind, the best induction into education was to feel the pulses of humanity which had beaten from age to age through the utterances of men who had penetrated to the secrets of the human spirit. And I agree with the intimation which has been conveyed to-day that the terrible war through which we have just passed has not been only a war between nations, but that it has been also a war between systems of culture—the one system, the aggressive system, using science without conscience, stripping learning of its moral restraints, and using every faculty of the human mind to do wrong to the whole race; the other system reminiscent of the high traditions of men, reminiscent of all those struggles, some of them obscure but others clearly revealed to the historian, of men of indomitable spirit everywhere struggling toward the right and seeking above all things else to be free. The triumph of freedom in this war means that spirits of that sort now dominate the world. There is a great wind of moral force moving through the world, and every man who opposes himself to that wind will go down in disgrace. The task of those who are gathered here, or will presently be gathered here, to make the settlements of this peace is greatly simplified by the fact that they are masters of no one; they are the servants of mankind, and if we do not heed the mandates of mankind we shall make ourselves the most conspicuous and deserved failures in the history of the world.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">My conception of the league of nations is just this, that it shall operate as the organized moral force of men throughout the world, and that whenever or wherever wrong and aggression are planned or contemplated, this searching light of conscience will be turned upon them and men everywhere will ask, “What are the purposes that you hold in your heart against the fortunes of the world?” Just a little exposure will settle most questions. If the central powers had dared to discuss the purposes of this war for a single fortnight, it never would have happened, and if, as should be, they were forced to discuss it for a year, war would have been inconceivable.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">So I feel that this <word altform="World War I">war</word> is, as has been said more than once to-day, intimately related with the university spirit. The university spirit is intolerant of all the things that put the human mind under restraint. It is intolerant of everything that seeks to retard the advancement of ideals, the acceptance of the truth, the purification of life; and every university man can ally himself with the forces of the present time with the feeling that now at last the spirit of truth, the spirit to which universities have devoted themselves, has prevailed and is triumphant. If there is one point of pride that I venture to entertain, it is that it has been my privilege in some measure to interpret the university spirit in the public life of a great Nation, and I feel that in honoring me to-day in this unusual and conspicuous manner you have first of all honored the people whom I represent. The spirit that I try to express I know to be their spirit, and in proportion as I serve them I believe that I advance the cause of freedom.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I, therefore, wish to thank you, sir, from the bottom of my heart for a distinction which has in a singular way crowned my academic career.</p>

         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I wish that I could give to each one of you the message that I know you are longing to receive from those at home who love you. I can not do that, but I can tell you how everybody at home is proud of you; how everybody at home has followed every movement of this great Army with confidence and affection; and how the whole people of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> are now waiting to welcome you home with an acclaim which probably has never greeted any other army. Because this is a war into which our country, like these countries we have been so proud to stand by, has put its whole heart, and the reason that we are proud of you is that you have put your heart into it; you have done your duty, and something more, you have done your duty and done it with a spirit which gave it distinction and glory. </p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">And now we are to have the fruits of victory. You knew when you came over what you came over for, and you have done what it was appointed you to do. I know what you expect of me. Some time ago a gentleman from one of the countries with which we are associated was discussing with me the moral aspects of this war, and I said that if we did not insist upon the high purposes for which this war was entered by the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> I could never look those gallant fellows across the seas in the face again. You knew what we expected of you and you did it. I know what you and the people at home expect of me; and I am happy to say, my fellow countrymen, that I do not find in the hearts of the great leaders with whom it is my privilege now to cooperate any difference of principle or of fundamental purpose. It happened that it was the privilege of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> to present the chart for peace, and now the process of settlement has been rendered comparatively simple by the fact that all the nations concerned have accepted that chart and that the application of those principles laid down there will be their explication. The world will now know that the nations that fought this war, as well as the soldiers who represented them, are ready to make good—make good not merely in the assertion of their own interests, but make good in the establishment of peace upon the permanent foundations of right and of justice. Because this is not a war in which the soldiers of the free nations have obeyed masters. You have commanders, but you have no masters. Your very commanders represent you in representing <placeRef reg="United States of America" refurl="0" link-pointer-type="place">the Nation</placeRef> of which you constitute so distinguished a part, and this being a people’s war, everybody concerned in the settlement knows that it must be a people’s peace, that nothing must be done in the settlement of the issues of the war which is not as handsome as the great achievements of the armies of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> and the allies.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">It is difficult, very difficult, men, in a formal speech like this to show you my real heart. You men probably do not realize with what anxious attention and care we have followed every step you have advanced, and how proud we are that every step was in advance and not in retreat; that every time you set your faces in any direction, you kept your faces in that direction. A thrill has gone through my heart, as it has gone through the heart of every American, with almost every gun that was fired and every stroke that was struck in the gallant fighting that you have done; and there has been only one regret in <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place>, and that was the regret that every man there felt that he was not here in <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">France</place>, too. It has been a hard thing to perform civil tasks in the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place>. It has been a hard thing to take part in directing what you did without coming over and helping you do it. It has taken a lot of moral courage to stay at home, but we were proud to back you up in every way that was possible to back you up, and now I am happy to find what splendid names you have made for yourselves among the civilian population of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">France</place> as well as among your comrades in arms of the French Army. It is a fine testimony to you men that these people like you and love you and trust you, and the finest part of it all is that you deserve their trust.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I feel a comradeship with you to-day which is delightful as I look about upon these undisturbed fields and think of the terrible scenes through which you have gone and realize now that the quiet peace, the tranquillity of settled hope, has descended upon us all; and while it is hard so far away from home confidently to bid you a Merry Christmas, I can, I think, confidently promise you a Happy New Year, and I can from the bottom of my heart say, God bless you.</p>

         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I feel that I have been peculiarly honored in the generous reception you have given me, and it is the more delightful because it so obviously comes from the heart; and I can not but believe that it is an instinctive response to the feeling that is in my own breast. Because I think that even you, after contact with our soldiers, can not realize the depth and sincerity of the feeling of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> for <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">France</place>. It is an ancient friendship, but it has been renewed and has taken on a new youth. It is a friendship which is not only one of sentiment, but one based upon a communion of principle.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">You have spoken very generously and very beautifully of the relations which have sprung up between yourselves and our soldiers. That is because they came not only to associate themselves with you as the champions of liberty, but they came with personal affection in their hearts for the people of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">France</place>, and it must have been that which you realized. They did not come as strangers in their thoughts. They brought with them something that made them feel at home the moment they were at <place reg="Havre, France" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Havre</place> or <place reg="Brest, France" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Brest</place> in France.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">So I am very much moved by being thus drawn, as they have been, into your midst and into your confidence, and wish to thank you very warmly for them and for the people of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place>. I, like them, shall carry away with me the most delightful recollections, and my heart will always say, as I now say, “Vive la <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">France</place>.”</p>

I think that in spite of all the terrible sufferings and sacrifices of this war we shall some day in looking back upon them realize that they were worthwhile, not only because of the security they gave the world against unjust aggression, but also because of the understanding they established between great nations which ought to act with each other in the <sic corr="permanent">parmanent</sic> maintenance of justice and of right.

         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I am deeply complimented by the gracious words which you have uttered. The welcome which you have given me and <person reg="Edith Bolling Wilson" refurl="x4004687" link-pointer-type="person">Mrs. Wilson</person> has been so warm, so natural, so evidently from the heart that we have been more than pleased; we have been touched by it, and I believe that I correctly interpret that welcome as embodying not only your own generous spirit toward us personally, but also as expressing for yourself and <placeRef reg="England" refurl="0" link-pointer-type="place">the great nation over which you preside</placeRef> that same feeling for my people, for the people of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place>. For you and I, sir—I temporarily—embody the spirit of two great nations; and whatever strength I have, and, whatever authority, I possess only so long and so far as I express the spirit and purpose of the American people.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Any influence that the American people have over the affairs of the world is measured by their sympathy with the aspirations of free men everywhere. <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> does love freedom, and I believe that she loves freedom unselfishly. But if she does not, she will not and can not help the influence to which she justly aspires. I have had the privilege, sir, of conferring with the leaders of your own Government and with the spokesmen of the Governments of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">France</place> and of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Italy</place>, and I am glad to say that I have the same conceptions that they have of the significance and scope of the duty upon which we have met. We have used great words, all of us, we have used the great words “right” and “justice,” and now we are to prove whether or not we understand those words and how they are to be applied to the particular settlements which must conclude this war. And we must not only understand them, but we must have the courage to act upon our understanding.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Yet, after I uttered the word “courage,” it comes into my mind that it would take more courage to resist the great moral tide now running in the world than to yield to it, than to obey it. There is a great tide running in the hearts of men. The hearts of men have never beaten so singularly in unison before. Men have never before been so conscious of their brotherhood. Men have never before realized how little difference there was between right and justice in one latitude and in another, under one sovereignty and under another; and it will be our high privilege, I believe, sir, not only to apply the moral judgments of the world to the particular settlements which we shall attempt, but also to organize the moral force of the world to preserve those settlements, to steady the forces of mankind and to make the right and the justice to which great nations like our own have devoted themselves the predominant and controlling force of the world.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">There is something inspiriting in knowing that this is the errand that we have come on. Nothing less than this would have justified me in leaving the important tasks which fall upon me upon the other side of the sea, nothing but the consciousness that nothing else compares with this in dignity and importance. Therefore it is the more delightful to find myself in the company of a body of men united in ideal and in purpose, to feel that I am privileged to unite my thought with yours in carrying forward those standards which we are so proud to hold high and to defend.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">May I not, sir, with a feeling of profound sincerity and friendship and sympathy propose your own health and the health of <personRef refurl="x4000446" link-pointer-type="person" reg="Queen Mary">the Queen </personRef>, and the prosperity of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Great Britain</place>?</p>

I think one would go crazy if he did not believe in Providence. It would be a maze without a clue. Unless there were some supreme guidance we would despair of the results of human counsel.

         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Your unexpected call upon me for a speech reminds me of an amusing incident which once took place near <place reg="Washington, DC" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Washington</place>.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">As you know, the American Capital is on the Potomac river, and one day a boy was fishing from the end of a raft anchored in the stream a short distance below the city, when the thing happened which very rarely  happens on the Potomac river, he got a bite. So excited was he in striving to get the fish out of the water that he lost his balance and fell over into the river. As he was struggling in the water to get back to the raft with the water streaming out of his eyes, nose, mouth and ears, a farmer passing along the bank called out to him: “Hello<del status="unremarkable"><gap reason="illegible" extent="oneortwoword"/></del><add>,</add> my boy, how did you come to fall in?” Quick as a flash the young fellow called back: “I didn’t come to fall in, you darn fool, I come to fish!” So I didn’t come here tonight to make a speech, but in the language of the signs we read on the railroad tracks, I came to “Stop, Look and Listen”. But since I am on my feet I cannot refrain, as no American or Englishman could, from saying a word of felicitation upon the splendid achievement by which your country and mind have just vindicated the courage of free peoples armed in defense of their freedom, and demonstrated not only that liberty and efficiency can function together, but that great democracies can impose such discipline upon themselves as to turn out a war machine that will outmatch the murderous devices of autocracy. In other words, we have not only made the world safe for democracy, but we have done a greater thing, for we have proven that democracy is safe for the world.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">It is  a privilege to live in this age. The events of the last five years have been the greatest in all recorded time; and the final triumph of civilization over savagery, the victory of right over might, makes of this day and hour an epoch beside which all history is dimmed.</p>
         <p rend="center" xml:space="preserve"><space dim="vertical" extent="1" units="em"/>“We are living, we are dwelling<br/>“In a grand and awful time,<br/>“In an age on ages telling,<br/>“To be living is sublime”.<space dim="vertical" extent="1" units="em"/></p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Hereafter, in my humble judgment, the history of mankind will be put into two grand divisions only, that before, and that after, this great world conflict.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve"><del status="unremarkable">I am not one of those who believe that without the aid of the United States the cause of the Allies would have been lost. I believe that while the war might have been prolonged, the issue, in the hidden scroll of God, was never for a moment in doubt; and the ultimate defeat of Germany was as certain when the arrogant invaders violated Belgian soil as it was when the cringing puppets of a fugitive emperor came to beg an armistice of <person refurl="x4000441" reg="Ferdinand Foch" link-pointer-type="person">General Foch</person>.</del></p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">But I am one of those who believe that the greatest good that has come out of this war is the bond of deathless friendship, born in a common cause, and dipped in fraternal blood, which shall forever unite the British empire and the Ame<del status="unremarkable">i</del><add>r</add>ican commonwealth.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">It is a curious fact that e<del status="unremarkable">c</del><add>x</add>cept for the Boxer uprising in <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">China</place> a few years ago, <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">England</place> and the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> never before, in their separate sovereignties, have fought side by side. We have fought two wars against each other, while in the several controversies which each has had in its own household, or with a third power, the other has often looked on with an unfriendly interest. But now, at last, on land and sea, English and American forces have fought so close together, that the colors of their flags were merged into one banner of the free. Heretofore, the tie that bound us was one language. Hereafter, we shall be one race. All of us must and do hope that this is the last of wars, and that from the waste and ashes of its fields will rise, Phoenix-like, a great covenant of mankind to compose the differences and enforce peace throughout the world. But mutual respect and affection which come from the comradeship of peri<del status="unremarkable">o</del><add>l</add> and sacrifice, and the consciousness of the same traditions, the same ideals and the same destiny, are safer guaranties of peace than written treaties or leagues of nations. <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">En<del status="unremarkable">n</del><add>g</add>land</place> and the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> now, at last, see each other “not through a glass darkly, but face to face”.</p>

         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">We have come upon times when ceremonies like this have a new significance, and it is that significance which most impresses me as I stand here. The address which I have just heard is most generously and graciously conceived and the delightful accent of sincerity in it seems like a part of that voice of counsel which is now everywhere to be heard.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I feel that a distinguished honor has been conferred upon me by this reception, and I beg to assure you, sir, and your associates of my very profound appreciation, but I know that I am only part of what I may call a great body of circumstances. I do not believe that it was fancy on my part that I heard in the voice of welcome uttered in the streets of <placeRef reg="London, England" refurl="0" link-pointer-type="place">this great city</placeRef> and in the streets of <place reg="Paris, France" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Paris</place> something more than a personal welcome. It seemed to me that I heard the voice of one people speaking to another people, and it was a voice in which one could distinguish a singular combination of emotions. There was surely there the deep gratefulness that the fighting was over. There was the pride that the fighting had had such a culmination. There was that sort of gratitude that the nations engaged had produced such men as the soldiers of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Great Britain</place> and of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> and of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">France</place> and of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Italy</place>—men whose prowess and achievements they had witnessed with rising admiration as they moved from culmination to culmination. But there was something more in it, the consciousness that the business is not yet done, the consciousness that it now rests upon others to see that those lives were not lost in vain.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I have not yet been to the actual battlefields, but I have been with many of the men who have fought the battles, and the other day I had the pleasure of being present at a session of the French Academy when they admitted <person refurl="x4000443" link-pointer-type="person" reg="Joseph Joffre">Marshal Joffre</person> to their membership. That sturdy, serene soldier stood and uttered, not the words of triumph, but the simple words of affection for his soldiers, and the conviction which he summed up, in a sentence which I will not try accurately to quote but reproduce in its spirit, was that <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">France</place> must always remember that the small and the weak could never live free in the world unless the strong and the great always put their power and strength in the service of right. That is the afterthought—the thought that something must be done now not only to make the just settlements, that of course, but to see that the settlements remained and were observed and that honor and justice prevailed in the world. And as I have conversed with the soldiers, I have been more and more aware that they fought for something that not all of them had defined, but which all of them recognized the moment you stated it to them. They fought to do away with an old order and to establish a new one, and the center and characteristic of the old order was that unstable thing which we used to call the “balance of power”—a thing in which the balance was determined by the sword which was thrown in the one side or the other; a balance which was determined by the unstable equilibrium of competitive interests; a balance which was maintained by jealous watchfulness and an antagonism of interests which, though it was generally latent, was always deep-seated. The men who have fought in this war have been the men from free nations who were determined that that sort of thing should end now and forever.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">It is very interesting to me to observe how from every quarter, from every sort of mind, from every concert of counsel, there comes the suggestion that there must now be, not a balance of power, not one powerful group of nations set off against another, but a single overwhelming, powerful group of nations who shall be the trustee of the peace of the world. It has been delightful in my conferences with the leaders of your Government to find how our minds moved along exactly the same line, and how our thought was always that the key to the peace was the guaranty of the peace, not the items of it; that the items would be worthless unless there stood back of them a permanent concert of power for their maintenance. That is the most reassuring thing that has ever happened in the world. When this war began the thought of a league of nations was indulgently considered as the interesting thought of closeted students. It was thought of as one of those things that it was right to characterize by a name which as a university man I have always resented; it was said to be academic, as if that in itself were a condemnation, something that men could think about but never get. Now we find the practical leading minds of the world determined to get it. No such sudden and potent union of purpose has ever been witnessed in the world before. Do you wonder, therefore, gentlemen, that in common with those who represent you I am eager to get at the business and write the sentences down; and that I am particularly happy that the ground is cleared and the foundations laid—for we have already accepted the same body of principles? Those principles are clearly and definitely enough stated to make their application a matter which should afford no fundamental difficulty. And back of us is that imperative yearning of the world to have all disturbing questions quieted, to have all threats against peace silenced, to have just men everywhere come together for a common object. The peoples of the world want peace and they want it now, not merely by conquest of arms but by agreement of mind.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">It was this incomparably great object that brought me overseas. It has never before been deemed excusable for a President of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> to leave the territory of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place>; but I know that I have the support of the judgment of my colleagues in the Government of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> in saying that it was my paramount duty to turn away even from the imperative tasks at home to lend such counsel and aid as I could to this great, may I not say, final enterprise of humanity.</p>

         <p rend="noindent" xml:space="preserve"> <render as="smallcap" rend="inherit">Mr. Lord Mayor, <personRef reg="George V" refurl="x4005024" link-pointer-type="person">Your Royal Highness</personRef>, Your Grace, Ladies and Gentlemen:</render> </p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">You have again made me feel, sir, the very wonderful and generous welcome of <placeRef reg="London, England" refurl="0" link-pointer-type="place">this great city</placeRef>, and you have reminded me of what has perhaps become one of the habits of my life. You have said that I have broken all precedents in coming across the ocean to join in the counsels of the peace conference, but I think those who have been associated with me in <place reg="Washington, D.C." rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Washington</place> will testify that that is nothing surprising. I said to members of the press in <place reg="Washington, D.C." rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Washington</place> one evening that one of the things that had interested me most since I lived in <place reg="Washington, D.C." rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Washington</place> was that every time I did anything perfectly natural it was said to be unprecedented. It was perfectly natural to break this precedent, natural because the demand for intimate conference took precedence over every other duty. And, after all, breaking of precedents, though this may sound strange doctrine in <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">England</place>, is the most sensible thing to do. The harness of precedent is sometimes a very sad and harassing trammel. In this case the breaking of precedent is sensible for a reason that is very prettily illustrated in a remark attributed to <person refurl="x4000426" link-pointer-type="person" reg="Charles Lamb">Charles Lamb</person>. One evening in a company of his friends they were discussing a person who was not present, and <person refurl="x4000426" link-pointer-type="person" reg="Charles Lamb">Lamb</person> said, in his hesitating manner, “I h-hate that fellow.” “Why, <person refurl="x4000426" link-pointer-type="person" reg="Charles Lamb">Charles</person>,” one of his friends said, “I didn’t know that you knew him.” “Oh,” he said, “I-I-I d-don’t; I c-can’t h-hate a man I-I-I know.” And perhaps that simple and attractive remark may furnish a secret for cordial international relationship. When we know one another we can not hate one another.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I have been very much interested before coming here to see what sort of person I was expected to be. So far as I can make it out, I was expected to be a perfectly bloodless thinking machine; whereas, I am perfectly aware that I have in me all the insurgent elements of the human race. I am sometimes by reason of long Scotch tradition able to keep those instincts in restraint. The stern covenanter tradition that is behind me sends many an echo down the years.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">It is not only diligently to pursue business but also to seek this sort of comradeship that I feel it a privilege to have come across the seas, and in the welcome that you have accorded <person reg="Edith Bolling Wilson" refurl="x4004687" link-pointer-type="person">Mrs. Wilson</person> and me you have made us feel that that companionship was accessible to us in the most delightful and enjoyable form. I thank you sincerely for this welcome, sir, and am very happy to join in a love feast which is all the more enjoyable because there is behind it a background of tragical suffering. Our spirits are released from the darkness of clouds that at one time seemed to have settled upon the world in a way that could not be dispersed; the suffering of your own people, the suffering of the people of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">France</place>, the infinite suffering of the people of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Belgium</place>. The whisper of grief that has blown all through the world is now silent, and the sun of hope seems to spread its rays and to change the earth with a new prospect of happiness. So our joy is all the more elevated because we know that our spirits are lifted out of that valley.</p>

And it is very delightful that members of the Government which brought this nation into <word altform="World War I">the war</word> because of the moral obligations based upon treaty should be among those who have brought me this paper, because on the other side of <word altform="Atlantic Ocean">the water</word> we have greatly admired the motives and subscribed to the principles which actuated the Government of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Great Britain</place>.

I remember <personRef refurl="0" link-pointer-type="person">my grandfather</personRef> very well, and remembering him as I do, I am confident that he would not approve of it. I remember how much he required. I remember the stern lessons of duty he gave me. I remember also, painfully, the things which he expected me to know which I did not know. I know there has come a change of times when a layman like myself is permitted to speak in a congregation. But I was reluctant because the feelings that have been excited in me are too intimate and too deep to permit of public expression. The memories that have come to me today of <personRef refurl="x4002345" reg="Janet Woodrow Wilson" link-pointer-type="person">the mother</personRef> who was born here are very affecting, and her quiet character, her sense of duty and dislike of ostentation, have come back to me with increasing force as those years of duty have accumulated.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">“Yet perhaps it is appropriate that in a place of worship I should acknowledge my indebtedness to her and <personRef refurl="0" link-pointer-type="person">her remarkable father</personRef>, because, after all, what the world is now seeking to do it to return to the paths of duty, to turn away from the savagery of interest to the dignity of the performance of right. And I believe that as <word altform="World War I">this war</word> has drawn the nations temporarily together in a combination of physical force we shall now be drawn together in a combination of moral force that will be irresistible.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">“It is moral force that is irresistible. It is moral force as much as physical that has defeated the effort to subdue the world. Words have cut as deep as the sword. The knowledge that wrong was being attempted has aroused the nations. They have gone out like men upon a crusade. No other cause could have drawn so many nations together. They knew that an outlaw was abroad who purposed unspeakable things. It is from quiet places like this all over the world that the forces accumulate which presently will overbear any attempt to accomplish evil on a large scale. Like the rivulets gathering in the river and the river into the sea, there come from communities like this streams that fertilize the consciences of men, and it is the conscience of the world that we are trying to place upon the throne which others would usurp.”<space dim="vertical" extent="3" units="em"/> </p>

         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">My Lord Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen; and perhaps I may be permitted to add Fellow Citizens:</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">You have made me feel in a way that is deeply delightful in the generous wlecome which you have accorded me. Back of it I know there lies the same sort of feeling for the great people whom I have the privilege of representing. There is a feeling of cordial fraternity and friendship between <placeRef reg="United States and Great Britain" refurl="0" link-pointer-type="place">these two great nations</placeRef>, and as I have gone from place to place and been made everwhere to feel the pulse of sympathy that is now beating between us, I have been led to some very serious thoughts as to what the basis of it all is. For I think you will agree with me that friendship is not a mere sentiment. Patriotism is not a mere sentiment. It is based upon a principle—upon a principle that leads a man to give more than he demands. And similarly, friendship is based, not merely upon affection, but upon common service. A man is not your friend who is not willing to serve you, and you are not his friend unless you are willing to serve him; and out of that impulse of common interest and a desire of common service rises that noble feeling which we have consecrated as friendship.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">So it has seemed to me that the theme we must have in our minds now in this great day of settlement is the theme of common interest and the determination of what it is that is our common interest. You know that heretofore the world has been governed, or at any rate an attempt has been made to govern it, by partnerships of interest, and they have broken down. Interest does not bind men together. Interest separates men, for the moment there is the slightest departure from the nice adjustment of interests the jealousies being to spring up. There is only one thing that can bind peoples together and that is a common devotion to right. Ever since the history of liberty began, men have talked about their rights, and it has taken several hundred years to make them perceive that the principal part of right is duty, and that unless a man performs his full duty he is entitled to no right. This fine correlation of the two things of duty and of right is the equipoise and balance of society. So when we analyze the present situation and the future that we now have to mould and control, it seems to me that there is no other thought than that that can guide us.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">You know that the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> has always felt from the very beginning of her history that she must keep herself separate from any kind of connection with European politics, and I want to say very frankly to you that she is not now interested in European politics. But she is interested in the partnership of right between <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> and <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Europe</place>. If the future had nothing for us but a new attempt to keep the world at a right poise by a balance of power, the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> would take no interest, because she will join no combination of power which is not the combination of the world. Therefore, it seems to me that in the settlement that is just ahead of us something more delicate and difficult than was ever attempted before is to be accomplished—a genuine concert of mind and purpose. But while it is difficult, there is an element present that makes it easy. Never before in the history of the world, I believe, has there been such a keen international consciousness as there is now. Men all over the world know that they have been embarrassed by national antagonisms and that the interest of each is the interest of all, and that men as men <supplied reason="editoriallyadded" cert="somedoubt">a</supplied>re the objects of government and international arrangements. There is a great voice of humanity abroad in the world just now which he who cannot hear is deaf. There is a great compulsion of common conscience now in existence which if any statesman resists he has gained the most unenviable eminence in history. We are not obeying the mandates of parties or of politics. We are obeying the mandates of humanity. That is the reason that it seems to me that the things that are most often in our minds are the least significant. I am not hopeful that the individual items of the settlements which we are about to attempt will be altogether satisfactory. One has but to apply his mind to any one of the questions of boundary and of altered sovereignty and of racial aspiration to do something more than conjecture that there is no man and no body of men who knows just how it ought to be settled. Yet, if we are to make unsatisfactory settlements, we must see to it that they are rendered more and more satisfactory by the subsequent adjustments which are made possible.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">So that we must provide a machinery of readjustment in order that we may have a machinery of good will and of friendship. Friendship must have a machinery. If I cannot correspond with you, if I cannot learn your mind, if I cannot cooperate with you, I cannot be your friend; and if the world is to remain a body of friends it must have the means of friendship, the means of constant friendly intercourse, the means of constant watchfulness over the common interest; not making it necessary to make a great effort upon some great occasion and confer with one another, but have an easy and constant method of conference, so that troubles may be taken when they are little and not allowed to grow until they are big. I never thought that I had a big difference with a man that I did not find when I came into conference with him that after all it was rather a little difference and if that we were frank with one another and did not too much stand upon that great enemy of mankind which is called pride, we could come together. It is the wish to come together that is more than half of the process. This is a doctrine which ought to be easy <del type="strikethrough" status="unremarkable">to</del> <add>of</add> comprehen<del type="strikethrough" status="unremarkable">d</del>sion in a great commercial center like this. You cannot trade with men who suspect you. You cannot establish commerical and industrial relations with those who do not trust you. Good will is the forerunner of trade, and trade is the great amicable instrument of the world on that account.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I feel—I felt before I came here—at home in <place reg="Manchester, England" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Manchester</place>, because <place reg="Manchester, England" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Manchester</place> has so many of the charactersistics of our great American cities. I was reminded of the anecdote of a humorous fellow-countryman who was sitting at lunch in his club one day and a man whom he did not like particularly came by and slapped him on the shoulder. “Hello, <person refurl="0" link-pointer-type="person">Ollie</person> old fellow; How are you?<supplied reason="editoriallyadded" cert="somedoubt">”</supplied> he said. <person refurl="0" link-pointer-type="person">Ollie</person> looked at him coldly and said “I don’t know your face; I don’t know your name, but your manners are very familiar.” I don’t know your names, but your manners are very familiar. They are very delightfully familiar. So that I feel that in the community of interest and of understanding which is established in great currents of trade we are enabled to see international processes perhaps better than they can be seen by others. I take it that I am not far from right in supposing that that is the reason why <place reg="Manchester, England" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Manchester</place> has been a center of the great forward-looking sentiments of men who had the instinct of large planning, not merely for the city itself, but for the Kingdom and the Empire, and the world; and with that outlook we can be sure that we can go shoulder to shoulder together.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I wish that it were possible for us to do something like some of my very stern ancestors did, for among my ancestors are those very determined persons who were known as the covenanters. I wish we could, not only for <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Great Britain</place> and the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place>, but for <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">France</place> and <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Italy</place> and the world, enter into a great league and covenant, declaring ourselves first of all friends of mankind and uniting ourselves together for the maintenance and the triumph of right.</p>

         <p rend="noindent" xml:space="preserve"> <render as="smallcap" rend="inherit">My Lord Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen:</render> </p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">You have again made me feel the cordiality of your friendship, and I want to tell you how much I appreciate it, not only on my own behalf but on behalf of my partner.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">It is very interesting that <personRef refurl="0" link-pointer-type="person">the Lord Mayor</personRef> should have referred in his address to a vital circumstance in our friendship. He referred to the fact that our men and your men had fought side by side in the great battles in <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">France</place>, but there was more than that in it. For the first time, upon such a scale at any rate, they fought under a common commander. That is the advance which we have made over previous times, and what I have been particularly interested in has been the generosity of spirit with which that unity of command has been assented to. I not only had the pleasure of meeting <person refurl="x4000441" link-pointer-type="person" reg="Ferdinand Foch">Marshal Foch</person>, who confirmed my admiration of him by the direct and simple manner in which he dealt with every subject that we talked about, but I have also had the pleasure of meeting your own commanders, and I understand how they cooperated, because I saw that they were real men. It takes a real man to subordinate himself. It takes a real soldier to know that unity of command is the secret of success, and that unity of command did swing the power of the nations into a mighty force. I think we all must have felt the new momentum which got into all the armies so soon as they became a single army, and we felt that we had overcome one of the most serious obstacles in the strength of the enemy, that he had unity of command and could strike where he would with a common plan and we could not.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">And with that unity of command there rose the unity of spirit. The minute we consented to cooperate our hearts were drawn together in the cooperation. So, from the military side we have given ourselves an example for the years to come; not that in the years to come we must submit to a unity of command, but it does seem to me that in the years to come we must plan a unity of purpose, and in that unity of purpose we shall find that great recompense, the strengthening of our spirits in everything that we do. There is nothing so hampering and nothing so demeaning as jealousy. It is a canker. It is a canker in the heart not only, but it is a canker in the counting room; it is a canker throughout all the processes of civilization. Having now seen that we can fight shoulder to shoulder, we will continue to advance shoulder to shoulder, and I think that you will find that the people of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> are the least eager of the parties.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I remember hearing a story of a warning which one of your Australian soldiers gave to one of ours. Our soldiers were considered by the older men a bit rash when they went in. I understand that even the Australians said that our men were a “bit rough,” and on one occasion a friendly Australian said to one of our men, “Man, a barrage is not a thing meant to lean up against.” They were a little bit inclined to lean up against the barrage, and yet I must confide to you that I was a bit proud of them for it. They had come over to get at the enemy, and they did not know why they should delay.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">And now that there is no common enemy except distrust and marring of plans, we can all feel the same eagerness in the new comradeship, and can feel that there is a common enterprise for it. For, after all, though we boast of the material sides of our civilization, they are merely meant to support the spiritual side. We are not men because we have skill of hand, but we are men because we have elevation of spirit. It is in the spirit that we live and not in the task of the day. If it is not, why is it that you hang the lad’s musket or his sword up above the mantelpiece and never hang his yardstick up? There is nothing discreditable in the yardstick. It is altogether honorable, but he is using it for his own sake. When he takes the musket or the sword, he is giving everything he has and getting nothing. It is honorable, not as an instrument of force, but as a symbol of self-sacrifice. A friend of mine said very truly that when peace is conducted in the spirit of war, there will be no war; when business is done with the point of view of the soldier, that he is serving his country, then business will be as histrionic as war. And I believe that from generation to generation conceptions of that sort are getting more and more currency and that men are beginning to see, not perhaps a golden age, but at any rate an age which is brightening from decade to decade and may lead us some time to an elevation from which we can see the things for which the heart of mankind has longed.</p>

         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I have been very much touched by the generous terms of the address which you have just read. I feel it would be difficult for me to make a worthy reply, and yet if I could speak simply the things that are in my heart I am sure they would constitute an adequate reply.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I had occasion at the Parliament this afternoon to speak of the strong sympathy that had sprung up between the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> and <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Italy</place> during the terrible years of the war, but perhaps here I could speak more intimately and say how sincerely the people of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> have admired your own course and your own constant association with the armies of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Italy</place>, and the gracious and generous and serving association of <personRef reg="Queen Elena" refurl="0" link-pointer-type="person">Her Majesty the Queen</personRef>.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">It has been a matter of pride with us that so many men of Italian origin were in our own armies and associated with their brethen of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Italy</place> itself in the great enterprise of freedom. These are no small matters, and they complete that process of welding together of the sympathies of nations which has been going on so long between our peoples. The Italians in the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> have excited a particular degree of admiration. They, I believe, are the only people of a given nationality who have been careful to organize themselves to see that their compatriots coming to <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> were from month to month and year to year guided to the places of the industries most suitable to their previous habits. No other nationality has taken such pains as that, and in serving their fellow countrymen they have served the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place>, because these people have found places where they would be most useful and would most immediately earn their own living, and they have thereby added to the prosperity of the country itself. In every way we have been happy in our association at home and abroad with the people of <placeRef reg="Italy" refurl="0" link-pointer-type="place">this great State</placeRef>.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I was saying playfully to <person refurl="x4005033" link-pointer-type="person" reg="Vittorio E. Orlando">Mr. Orlando</person> and <person refurl="x4000429" link-pointer-type="person" reg="Giorgio S. Sonnino">Baron Sonnino</person> this afternoon that in trying to put the peoples of the world under their proper sovereignties we would not be willing to part with the Italians in the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place>. We would not be willing, unless they desired it, that you should resume possession of them, because we too much value the contribution that they have made, not only to the industry of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> but to its thought and to many elements of its life. This is, therefore, a very welcome occasion upon which to express a feeling that goes very deep. I was touched the other day to have an Italian, a very plain man, say to me that we had helped to feed <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Italy</place> during the war, and it went to my heart, because we had been able to do so little. It was necessary for us to use our tonnage so exclusively for the handling of troops and of the supplies that had to follow them from the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> that we could not do half as much as it was our desire to do, to supply grain to this country, or coal, or any of the supplies which it so much needed during the progress of the war. And knowing as we did in this indirect way the needs of the country, you will not wonder that we were moved by its steadfastness. My heart goes out to the little poor families all over this great kingdom who stood the brunt and the strain of the war and gave their men gladly to make other men free and other women and children free. Those are the people, and many like them, to whom after all we owe the glory of this great achievement, and I want to join with you, for I am sure I am joining with you, in expressing my profound sympathy not only, but my very profound admiration as well.</p>

         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">You have done me a very great honor. Perhaps you can imagine what a feeling it is for a citizen of one of the newest of the great nations to be made a citizen of <place reg="Rome, Italy" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">this ancient city</place>. It is a distinction which I am sure you are conferring upon me as the respresentative of the great people for whom I speak. One who has been a student of history can not accept an honor of this sort without having his memory run back to the extraordinary series of events which have centered in this place. But as I have thought to-day, I have been impressed by the contrast between the temporary and the permanent things. Many political changes have centered about <place reg="Rome, Italy" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Rome</place>, from the time when from a little city she grew to be the mistress of an empire, and change after change has swept away many things, altering the very form of her affairs, but the thing that has remained permanent has been the spirit of <place reg="Rome, Italy" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Rome</place> and of the Italian people. That spirit seems to have caught with each age the characteristic purpose of the age. This imperial people now gladly represents the freedom of nations. This people which at one time seemed to conceive the purpose of governing the world now takes part in the liberal enterprise of offering the world its own government. Can there be a finer or more impressive illustration of the indestructible human spirit, and of the unconquerable spirit of liberty?</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I have been reflecting in these recent days about a colossal blunder that has just been made—the blunder of force by the Central Empires. If <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Germany</place> had waited a single generation, she would have had a commercial empire of the world. She was not willing to conquer by skill, by enterprise, by commercial success. She must needs attempt to conquer by arms, and the world will always acclaim the fact that it is impossible to conquer it by arms; that the only thing that conquers it is the sort of service which can be rendered in trade, in intercourse, in friendship, and that there is no conquering power which can suppress the freedom of the human spirit.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I have rejoiced personally in the partnership of the Italian and the American people, because it was a new partnership in an old enterprise, an enterprise predestined to succeed wherever it is undertaken—the enterprise that has always borne that handsome name which we call “Liberty.” Men have pursued it sometimes like a mirage that seemed to elude them, that seemed to run before them as they advanced, but never have they flagged in their purpose to achieve it, and I believe that I am not deceived in supposing that in this age of ours they are nearer to it than they ever were before. The light that shined upon the summit now seems almost to shine at our feet, and if we lose it, it will be only because we have lost faith and courage, for we have the power to attain it.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">So it seems to me that there never was a time when a greater breath of hope and of confidence had come into the minds and the hearts of men like the present. I would not have felt at liberty to come away from <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> if I had not felt that the time had arrived when, forgetting local interests and local ties and local purposes, men should unite in this great enterprise which will ever tie free men together as a body of brethren and a body of free spirits.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I am honored, sir, to be taken into this ancient comradeship of the citizenship of <place reg="Rome, Italy" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Rome</place>.</p>

         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">You are bestowing upon me an unprecedented honor, which I accept because I believe that it is extended to me as the representative of the great people for whom I speak, and I am going to take this opportunity to say how entirely the heart of the American people has been with the great people of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Italy</place>. We have seemed no doubt indifferent at times, to look on from a great distance, but our hearts have never been far away. All sorts of ties have long bound the people of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> to the people of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Italy</place>, and when the people of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place>, knowing this people, have witnessed its sufferings, its sacrifices, its heroic action upon the battle field and its heroic endurance at home—its steadfast endurance at home touching us more nearly to the quick even than its heroic action on the battle field—we have been bound by a new tie of profound admiration. Then, back of it all and through it all, running like the golden thread that wove it together, was our knowledge that the people of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Italy</place> had gone into this war for the same exalted principles of right and justice that moved our own people. And so I welcome this opportunity of conveying to you the heartfelt greetings of the people of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place>.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">But we can not stand in the shadow of <word altform="World War I">this war</word> without knowing that there are things awaiting us which are in some senses more difficult than those we have undertaken. While it is easy to speak of right and justice, it is sometimes difficult to work them out in practice, and there will require a purity of motive and disinterestedness of object which the world has never witnessed before in the councils of nations. It is for that reason that it seems to me that you will forgive me if I lay some of the elements of the new situation before you for a moment. The distinguishing fact of this war is that great empires have gone to pieces, and the characteristic of those empires was that they held different peoples reluctantly together under the coercion of force and the guidance of intrigue. The great difficulty among such States as those of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Balkans</place> has been that they were always accessible to secret influence; that they were always being penetrated by intrigue of one sort and another; and that north of them lay disturbed populations which were held together, not by sympathy and friendship, but by the coercive force of a military power. Now the intrigue is checked and the bands are broken, and what are we going to do to provide a new cement to hold these people together? They have not been accustomed to being independent. They must now be independent. I am sure that you recognize the principle as I do that it is not our privilege to say what sort of government they shall set up, but we are friends of these people and it is our duty as their friends to see to it that some kind of protection is thrown around them, something supplied which will hold them together. There is only one thing that holds nations together, if you exclude force, and that is friendship and good will. The only thing that binds men together is friendship and by the same token the only thing that binds nations together is friendship.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Therefore, our task at <place reg="Paris, France" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Paris</place> is to organize the friendship of the world, to see to it that all the moral forces that make for right and justice and liberty are united and are given a vital organization to which the peoples of the world will readily and gladly respond. In other words, our task is no less colossal than this, to set up a new international psychology, to have a new atmosphere. I am happy to say that in my dealings with the distinguished gentlemen who lead your nation and these who lead <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">France</place> and <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">England</place>, I feel that atmosphere gathering, that desire to do justice, that desire to establish friendliness, that desire to make peace rest upon right; and with this common purpose no obstacle need be formidable. The only use of an obstacle is to be overcome. All that an obstacle does with brave men is, not to frighten them, but to challenge them. So that it ought to be our pride to overcome everything that stands in the way.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">We know that there can not be another balance of power. That has been tried and found wanting, for the best of all reasons that it does not stay balanced inside itself, and a weight which does not hold together can not constitute a makeweight in the affairs of men. Therefore, there must be something substituted for the balance of power, and I am happy to find everywhere in the air of these great nations the conception that that thing must be a thoroughly united league of nations. What men once considered theoretical and idealistic turns out to be practical and necessary. We stand at the opening of a new age in which a new statesmanship will, I am confident, lift mankind to new levels of endeavor and achievement.</p>

         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I have listened, sir, with the profoundest appreciation to the beautiful address which you have been kind enough to deliver, and I want to say how deeply I appreciate the honor you have conferred upon me in permitting me to become a member of this great Academy, because there is a sense in which the continuity of human thought is in the care of bodies like this. There is a serenity, a long view on the part of science which seems to be of no age, but to carry human thought along from generation to generation, freed from the elements of passion. Therefore, it is, I dare say, with all men of science a matter of profound regret and shame that science should in <word altform="Germany">a nation which had made science its boast</word> have been put to such dishonorable uses in <word altform="World War I">the recent war</word>. Every just mind must condemn those who so debased the studies of men of science as to use them against humanity, and therefore, it is part of your task and of ours to reclaim science from this disgrace, to show that she is devoted to the advancement and interest of humanity and not to its embarrassment and destruction.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I wish very much, sir, that I could believe that I was in some sense a worthy representative of the men of science of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place>. I can not claim to be in any proper sense a man of science. My studies have been in the field of politics all my life and, while politics may by courtesy be called a science, it is a science which is often practiced without rule and is very hard to set up standards for, so that one can be sure that one is steering the right course. At the same time, while perhaps there is no science of government, there ought to be I dare say in government itself the spirit of science, that is to say, the spirit of disinterestedness, the spirit of seeking after the truth so far as the truth is ready to be applied to human circumstances. Because, after all, the problem of politics is to satisfy men in the arrangements of their lives, is to realize for them so far as possible the objects which they have entertained generation after generation and have seen so often postponed. Therefore, I have often thought that the university and the academy of science have their part in simplifying the problems of politics and therefore assisting to advance human life along the lines of political structure and political action.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">It is very delightful to draw apart for a little while into this quiet place and feel again that familiar touch of thought and of knowledge which it has been my privilege to know familiarly through so great a part of my life. If I have come out upon a more adventurous and disordered stage, I hope that I have not lost the recollection and may in some sense be assisted by counsels such as yours.</p>

         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Let me thank you, gentlemen, very warmly, for this stirring address, because it goes straight to my heart as well as to my understanding. If I had known that this important delegation was coming to see me, I would have tried to say something worthy of the occasion. As it is, speaking without preparation, I can only say that my purpose is certainly expressed in that paper, and I believe that the purpose of those associated at <place reg="Paris, France" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Paris</place> is a common purpose. Justice and right and big things, and in these circumstances they are big with difficulty. I am not foolish enough to suppose that our decisions will be easy to arrive at, but the principles upon which they are to be arrived at ought to be indisputable, and I have the conviction that if we do not rise to the expectation of the world and satisfy the souls of great peoples like the people of Italy, we shall have the most unenviable distinction in history. Because what is happening now is that the soul of one people is crying to the soul of another, and no people in the world with whose sentiments I am acquainted wishes a bargaining settlement. They all want settlements based upon what is right, or as nearly right as human judgment can arrive at, and with this atmosphere of the opinion of mankind to work in, it ought to be impossible to go very far astray. So that so long as the thought of the people keeps clear, the conclusions of their representatives ought to keep clear. We need the guidance of the people; we need the constant expression of the purposes and ideals of the people.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I have been associated with so many of your fellow countrymen in <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place>, and I am proud to call so many of them my own fellow-countrymen, that I would be ashamed if I did not feel the pulse of this great people beating in these affairs. I believe there are almost as many Italians in <place reg="New York, NY" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">New York City</place> as in almost any city in <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Italy</place>, and I was saying to-day that in redistributing sovereignty we could hardly let <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Italy</place> have these valued fellow-citizens. They are men who have done some things that the men of no other nationality have done. They have looked after the people coming from <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Italy</place> to the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> in a systematic way, to see that they were guided to the places and occupations for which they were best prepared, and they have won our admiration by this thoughtfulness for us. It is with a feeling of being half at home that I find myself in this capital of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Italy</place>.</p>

On the other side of the water we have studied the life of <person refurl="x4000445" link-pointer-type="person" reg="Giuseppe Mazzini">Mazzini</person> with almost as much pride as if we shared in the glory of his history, and I am very glad to acknowledge that his spirit has been handed down to us of a later generation on both sides of the water. It is delightful to me to feel that I am taking some small part in accomplishing the realization of the ideals to which his life and thought were devoted. It is with a spirit of veneration, sir, and with a spirit I hope of emulation, that I stand in the presence of this monument and bring my greetings and the greetings of America with our homage to the great <person refurl="x4000445" link-pointer-type="person" reg="Giuseppe Mazzini">Mazzini</person>.</p>

         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">It is with many feelings of a very deep sort, perhaps too deep for adequate expression, that I find myself in <place reg="Genoa, Italy" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Genoa</place>. <place reg="Genoa, Italy" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Genoa</place> is a natural shrine for Americans. The connections of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> with <place reg="Genoa, Italy" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Genoa</place> are so many and so significant that there are some senses in which it may be said that we drew our life and beginnings from this city. You can realize, therefore, sir, with what emotion I receive the honor which you have so generously conferred upon me of the citizenship of this great city. In a way it seems natural for an American to be a citizen of <place reg="Genoa, Italy" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Genoa</place>, and I shall always count it among the most delightful associations of my life that you should have conferred this honor upon me, and in taking away this beautiful edition of the works of <person refurl="x4000445" link-pointer-type="person" reg="Giuseppe Mazzini">Mazzini</person> I hope that I shall derive inspiration from these volumes, as I have already derived guidance from the principles which <person refurl="x4000445" link-pointer-type="person" reg="Giuseppe Mazzini">Mazzini</person> so eloquently expressed. It is very inspiring, sir, to feel how the human spirit is refreshed again and again from its original sources. It is delightful to feel how the voice of one people speaks to another through the mouth of men who have by some gift of God been lifted above the common level and seen the light of humanity, and therefore these words of your prophet and leader will, I hope, be deeply planted in the hearts of my fellow countrymen. There is already planted in those hearts, sir, a very deep and genuine affection for the great Italian people, and the thoughts of my own Nation turn constantly as we read our own history to this beautiful and distinguished city.</p>

It is for this reason no doubt, besides his fine spirit of adventure, that <person reg="Christopher Columbus" refurl="0" link-pointer-type="person">Columbus</person> will always be remembered and honored not only here in the land of his birth, but throughout the world as the man who led the way to those fields of freedom which, planted with a great seed, have now sprung up to the fructification of the world.</p>

It is delightful to feel how your thoughts have turned towards us, because our thoughts first turned towards you, and they turn toward you from not a new but an ancient friendship, because the American people have long felt the pulse of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Italy</place> beat with their pulse in the desire for freedom. We have been students of your history, sir. We know the vicissitudes and struggles through which you have passed. We know that no nation has more steadfastly held to a single course of freedom in its desires and efforts than have the people of Italy, and therefore I come to this place, where the life of Italy seems to beat so strong, with a peculiar gratification. I feel that I am privileged to come into contact with you, and I want you to know how the words that I am uttering of sympathy and of friendship are not my own alone, but they are the words of the great people whom I represent. I was saying a little while ago at the monument to <person reg="Christopher Columbus" refurl="0" link-pointer-type="person">Columbus</person> that he did a great thing, greater even than was realized at the time it was done. He discovered <word altform="North America">a new continent</word> not only, but he opened it to children of freedom, and those children are now privileged to come back to their mother and to assist her in the high enterprise upon which her heart had always been set.</p>

I have never known such a greeting as the people of <place reg="Milan, Italy" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Milan</place> have given me on the streets. It has brought tears to my eyes, because I know that it comes from their hearts. I can see in their faces the same things that I feel towards them, and I know that it is an impulse of their friendship towards <placeRef reg="United States of America" refurl="0" link-pointer-type="place">the Nation that I represent</placeRef> as well as a gracious welcome to myself. I want to reecho the hope that we may all work together for a great peace as distinguished from a mean peace. And may I suggest this, that is a great deal in my thoughts: The world is not going to consist now of great empires. It is going to consist for the most part of small nations apparently, and the only thing that can bind small nations together is the knowledge that each wants to treat the others fairly. That is the only thing. The world has already shown that its progress is industrial. You can not trade with people whom you do not trust, and who do not trust you. Confidence is the basis of everything that we must do, and it is a delightful feeling that those ideals are sustained by the people of Italy and by a wonderful body of people such as you have in this great city of <place reg="Milan, Italy" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Milan</place>. It is with a sense of added encouragement and strength that I return to <place reg="Paris, France" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Paris</place> to take part in the counsels that will determine the items of the peace. I thank you with all my heart.</p>

         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve"> May I not say to you as the representative of this great city that it is impossible for me to put into words the impressions I have received to-day? The overwhelming welcome, the spontaneous welcome, the welcome that so evidently came from the heart, has been profoundly moving to me, sir, and I have not failed to see the significance of that welcome. You have yourself referred to it. I am as keenly aware, I believe, sir, as anybody can be that the social structure rests upon the great working classes of the world, and that those working classes in the several countries of the world have by their consciousness of community of interest, by their consciousness of community of spirit, done perhaps more than any other other influence has to establish a world opinion, an opinion which is not of a nation, which is not of a continent, but is the opinion, one might say, of mankind. And I am aware, sir, that those of us who are now charged with the very great and serious responsibility of concluding the peace must think and act and confer in the presence of this opinion; that we are not masters of the fortunes of any nation, but that we are the servants of mankind; that it is not our privilege to follow special interests, but that it is our manifest duty to study only the general interest.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">This is a solemn thing, sir, and here in <place reg="Milan, Italy" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Milan</place>, where I know so much of the pulse of international sympathy beats, I am glad to stand up and say that I believe that that pulse beats also in my own veins, and that I am not thinking of particular settlements so much as I am of the general settlement. I was very much touched to-day, sir, to receive at the hands of wounded soldiers a memorial in favor of a league of nations, and to be told by them that that was what they had fought for; not merely to win this war, but to secure something beyond, some guarantee of justice, some equilibrium for the world as a whole which would make it certain that they would never have to fight a war like this again. This is the added obligaiton that is upon us who make peace. We can not merely sign a treaty of peace and go home with clear consciences. We must do something more. We must add, so far as we can, the securities which suffering men everywhere demand; and when I speak of suffering men I think also of suffering women. I know that splendid as have been the achievements of your armies, and tremendous as have been the sacrifices which they have made, and great the glory which they have achieved, the real, hard pressure of the burden came upon the women at home, whose men had gone to the front and who were willing to have them stay there until the battle was fought out; and as I have heard from your Minister of Food the story how for days together there would be no bread, and then know that when there was no bread the spirit of the people did not flag. I take off my hat to the great people of Italy and tell them that my admiration is merged into friendship and affection. It is in this spirit that I receive your courtesy, sir, and thank you from the bottom of my heart for this unprecedented reception which I have received at the hands of your generous people.</p>

         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve"> <render as="smallcap" rend="inherit">Mr. Chairman:</render> </p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve"> Again you have been very gracious, and again you have filled my heart with gratitude because of your references to <placeRef reg="United States of America" refurl="0" link-pointer-type="place">my own country</placeRef>, which is so dear to me. I have been very much interested to be told, sir, that you are the chairman of a committee of entertainment which includes all parties, without distinction. I am glad to interpret that to mean that there is no division recognized in the friendship which is entertained for <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place>, and I am sure, sir, that I can assure you that in <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> there would be a similar union of all parties to express friendship and sympathy with <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Italy</place>. Because, after all, parties are founded upon differences of program and not often upon differences of national sympathy. The thing that makes parties workable and tolerable is that all parties love their own country and therefore participate in the general sentiments of that country.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">And so it is with us, sir. We have many parties, but we have a single sentiment in this war and a single sentiment in the peace; and at the heart of that sentiment lies our feeling towards those with whom we have been associated in the great struggle. At first the struggle seemed the mere natural resistance to aggressive force, but as the consciousness of the nations grew it became more and more evident to them that they were fighting something that was more than the aggression of the Central Empires. It was the spirit of militarism, the spirit of autocracy, the spirit of force; and against that spirit rose, as always in the past, the spirit of liberty and of justice. Force can always be conquered, but the spirit of liberty never can be, and the beautiful circumstance about the history of liberty is that its champions have always shown the power of self-sacrifice, have always been willing to subordinate their personal interests to the common good, have not wished to dominate their fellow men, but have wished to serve them. This is what gives dignity; this is what gives imperishable victory. And with that victory has come about things that are exemplified by a scene like this—the coming together of the hearts of nations, the sympathy of great bodies of people who do not speak the same vocabulary but do speak the same ideas. I am heartened by this delightful experience and hope that you will accept, not only my thanks for myself and for those who are with me but also my thanks on behalf of the American people.</p>

         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve"> <render as="smallcap" rend="inherit"><personRef refurl="0" link-pointer-type="person">Mr. Mayor</personRef>, <personRef refurl="0" link-pointer-type="person">Your Excellency</personRef>, Fellow Citizens:</render> </p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve"> You show your welcome in many delightful ways and in no more delightful way than that in which you have shown it in this room. The words which the mayor has uttered have touched me very much and I have been most touched and stimulated by the words which <person refurl="0" link-pointer-type="person">Senor Postorelli</person> has so kindly uttered in behalf of the Government of this great kingdom. It is very delightful to feel my association with that government and with this city. I know how much of the vitality of Italian effort comes out of this great center of industry and of thought. As I passed through your streets I had this sensation, a sensation which I have often had in my own dear country at home—a sensation of friendship and close sympathetic contact. I could have believed myself in an American city. And I felt more than that. I felt, as I have also felt at home, that the real blood of the country flowed there in the street, in the veins of those plain people who more than some of the rest of us have borne the stress and burden of the war.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Because think of the price at which you and at which we have purchased the victory which we have won. Think of the price of blood and treasure not only, but the price of tears, the price of hunger on the part of little children, the hopes delayed, the dismay of the prospects, that bore heavy upon the homes of simple people everywhere. That is the price of liberty. Those of us who plan battles, those of us who conceive policies, do not bear the burden of it. We direct and others execute. We plan and others suffer, and the conquest of spirit is greater than the conquest of arms. These are the people that hold tight. These are the people that never let go and say nothing. They merely live from day to day, determined that the glory of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Italy</place> or the glory of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> shall not depart from her. I have been thinking as I have passed through your streets and sat here that this was the place of the labors of the great <person refurl="x4000444" link-pointer-type="person" reg="Camillo Cavour">Cavour</person>, and I have thought how impossible many of the things that have happened in <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Italy</place> since, how impossible the great achievements of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Italy</place> in the last three years, would have been without the work of <person refurl="x4000444" link-pointer-type="person" reg="Camillo Cavour">Cavour</person>. Ever since I was a boy one of my treasured portraits has been a portrait of <person refurl="x4000444" link-pointer-type="person" reg="Camillo Cavour">Cavour</person>; because I had read about him, of the way in which his mind took in the nation, the national scope of it, of the strong determined patriotic endeavor that never allowed obstacles to dismay him, and of the way he always stood at the side of <personRef reg="Victor Emmanuel II" refurl="0" link-pointer-type="person">the King</personRef> and planned the great things which <personRef reg="Victor Emmanuel II" refurl="0" link-pointer-type="person">the King</personRef> was enabled to accomplish.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">And I have another thought. This is a great industrial center. Perhaps you gentlemen think of the members of your Government and the members of other governments who are going to confer now at <place reg="Paris, France" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Paris</place> as the real makers of war and of peace. We are not. You are the makers of war and of peace. The pulse of the modern world beats on the farm and in the mine and in the factory. The plans of the modern world are made in the counting house. The men who do the business of the world now shape the destinies of the world, and peace or war is in large measure in the hands of those who conduct the commerce of the world. That is one reason why unless we establish friendships, unless we establish sympathies, we clog all the processes of modern life. As I have several times said, you can not trade with a man who does not trust you, and you will not trade with a man whom you do not trust. Trust is the very life and breadth of business; and suspicion, unjust national rivalry stands in the way of trade, stands in the way of industry. A country is owned and dominated by the capital that is invested in it. I do not need to instruct you gentlemen in that fundamental idea. In proportion as foreign capital comes in among you and takes its hold in that proportion does foreign influence come in and take its hold. And therefore the processes of capital are in a certain sense the processes of conquest.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I have only this to suggest, therefore. We go to <place reg="Paris, France" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Paris</place> to conclude a peace. You stay here to continue it. We start the peace. It is your duty to continue it. We can only make the large conclusions. You constantly transact the details which constitute the processes of the life of nations.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">And so it is very delightful to me to stand in this company and feel that we are not foreigners to each other. We think the same thoughts. We entertain the same purposes. We have the same ideals; and this war has done this inestimable service: It has brought nations into close vital contact, so that they feel the pulses that are in each other, so that they know the purposes by which each is animated. We know in <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> a great deal about <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Italy</place>, because we have so many Italian fellow citizens. When <person refurl="0" link-pointer-type="person">Baron Soninno</person> was arguing the other day for the extension of the sovereignty of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Italy</place> over Italian populations, I said, “I am sorry we can not let you have <place reg="New York, NY" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">New York</place>, which, I understand, is the greatest Italian city in the world.” I am told that there are more Italians in <place reg="New York, NY" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">New York City</place> than in any city in <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Italy</place>, and I am proud to be President of a Nation which contains so large an element of the Italian race, because, as a student of literature, I know the genius that has originated in this great nation, the genius of thought and of poetry and of philosophy and of music, and I am happy to be a part of a Nation which is enriched and made better by the introduction of such elements of genius and of inspiration.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">May I not again thank the representatives of this great city and the representative of the Government for the welcome they have given me, and say again, for I can not say it too often, Viva l’Italia?</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve"> <space dim="vertical" extent="2" units="em"/> </p>
         <p rend="center" xml:space="preserve"> <render as="smallcap" rend="inherit">On The Balcony At The Philharmonic Club.</render> </p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve"> <space dim="vertical" extent="2" units="em"/> </p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">It is very delightful to feel your friendship given so cordially and so graciously, and I hope with all my heart that in the peace that is now about to be concluded Italy may find her happiness and her prosperity. I am sure that I am only speaking the sentiments that come from the heart of the American people when I say, Viva l’Italia.</p>

         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve"> Both on the streets of this interesting city and here you have made me feel at home. I feel almost as if it were the greeting of a people of whom I was indeed a fellow citizen. I am very much honored that this great city, playing so important a rôle in the life and in the industrial endeavor of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Italy</place>, should have conferred this high distinction upon me, and I take the liberty of interpreting your action, sir, not merely as a personal compliment to myself, to whom you ascribe virtues and powers which I feel I do not possess, but as a tribute to the people whom I represent.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The people of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> were reluctant to take part in <word altform="World War I">the war</word>, not because they doubted the justice of the cause, but because it was the tradition of the American Republic to play no part in the politics of other continents, but as the struggle grew from stage to stage they were more and more moved by the conviction that it was not a European struggle; that it was a struggle for the freedom of world and the liberation of humanity, and with that conviction it was impossible that they should withhold their hand. Their hearts had been with you from the first, and then when the time of their conviction came they threw every resource of men and money and enthusiasm into the struggle. It has been a very happy circumstance that <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> should be thus associated with Italy. Our ties had been many and intimate before the war, and now they constitute a pledge of friendship and of permanent association of purpose which must delight both people.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">May I not, therefore, again thank you for the honor you have conferred upon me, and take the privilege of greeting you affectionately as my fellow citizens?</p>

         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve"> It is with a feeling of being in very familiar scenes that I come here to-day. So soon as I entered the quadrangle and heard the voices of the students it seemed to me as if the greater part of my life had come back to me, and I am particularly honored that this distinguished university should have received me among its sons. It will always be a matter of pride with me to remember this association and the very generous words in which these honors have been conferred upon me.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">When I think seriously of the significance of a ceremony like this, some very interesting reflections come to my mind, because, after all, the comradeships of letters, the intercommunications of thought, are among the permanent things of the world. There was a time when scholars, speaking in the beautiful language in which the last address was made, were the only international characters of the world; when there was only one international community; the community of scholars. As ability to read and write has extended, international intercommunication has extended. But one permanent common possession has remained, and that is the validity of sound thinking. When men have thought along the lines of philosophy, have had revealed to them the visions of poetry, have worked out in their studies the permanent lines of law, have realized the great impulses of humanity, and then begun to advance human life materially by the instrumentalities of science, they have been weaving a human web which no power can permanently tear and destroy. And so in being taken into the comradeship of this university I feel that I am being taken into one of those things which will always bind the nations together. After all, when we are seeking peace, we are seeking nothing else than this, that men shall think the same thoughts, govern their conduct by the same ideals, entertain the same purposes, love their own people, but also love humanity, and above all else, love that great and indestructible thing which we call justice and right.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">These things are greater than we are. These are our real masters, for they dominate our spirits, and the universities will have forgotten their duty when they cease to weave this immortal web. It is one of the chief griefs of this great war that the universities of the Central Empires used the thoughts of science to destroy mankind. It is the duty of the great universities of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Italy</place> and of the rest of the world to redeem science from this disgrace, to show that the pulse of humanity beats in the classroom, that the pulse of humanity also beats in the laboratory, and that there are sought out, not the secrets of death but the secrets of life.</p>

         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve"> It gives me great pleasure to propose as permanent chairman of the conference <person refurl="x4004688" link-pointer-type="person" reg="Georges Clemenceau">M. Clemenceau</person>, the president of the council. I would do this as a matter of custom. I would do it as a tribute to the French Republic. But I wish to do it as something more than that. I wish to do it as a tribute to the man. <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">France</place> deserves the precedence not only because we are meeting in her capital and because she has undergone some of the most tragical sufferings of <word altform="World War I">the war</word>, but also because her capital, her ancient and beautiful capital, has so often been the center of conferences of this sort upon which the fortunes of large parts of the world turned. It is a very delightful thought that the history of the world, which has so often centered here, will now be crowned by the achievements of this conference. Because there is a sense in which this is the supreme conference of the history of mankind. More nations are represented here than were ever represented in such a conference before. The fortunes of all peoples are involved. A great war is ended which seemed about to bring a universal cataclysm. The danger is passed. A victory has been won for mankind, and it is delightful that we should be able to record these great results in this place.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">But it is the more delightful to honor <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">France</place> because we can honor her in the person of so distinguished a servant. We have all felt in our participation in the struggles of this war the fine steadfastness which characterized the leadership of the French people in the hands of <person refurl="x4004688" link-pointer-type="person" reg="Georges Clemenceau">M. Clemenceau</person>. We have learned to admire him, and those of us who have been associated with him have acquired a genuine affection for him. Moreover, those of us who have been in these recent days in constant consultation with him know how warmly his purpose is set toward the goal of achievement to which all our faces are turned. He feels as we feel, as I have no doubt everybody in this room feels, that we are trusted to do a great thing, to do it in the highest spirit of friendship and accomodation, and to do it as promptly as possible, in order that the hearts of men may have fear lifted from them and that they may return to those pursuits of life which will bring them happiness and contentment and prosperity. Knowing his brotherhood of heart in these great matters, it affords me a personal pleasure to propose not only that the president of the council of ministers, but <person refurl="x4004688" link-pointer-type="person" reg="Georges Clemenceau">M. Clemenceau</person>, shall be the permanent chairman of this conference.</p>

         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve"> You have made me feel your welcome in words as generous as they are delightful, and I feel that you have paid me to-day a very unusual and distinguished honor. You have graciously called me your friend. May not I in turn call this company a company of my friends? For everything that you have so finely said to-day, sir, has been corroborated in every circumstance of our visit to this country. Everywhere we have been welcomed not only, but welcomed in the same spirit and with the same thought, until it has seemed as if the spirits of the two countries came together in an unusual and beautiful accord.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">We know the long breeding of peril through which <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">France</place> has gone. <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">France</place> thought us remote in comprehension and sympathy, and I dare say there were times when we did not comprehend as you comprehended the danger in the presence of which the world stood. There was no time when we did not know of its existence, but there were times when we did not know how near it was. And I fully understand, sir, that throughout these trying years, when mankind has waited for the catastrophe, the anxiety of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">France</place> must have been the deepest and most constant of all. For she did stand at the frontier of freedom. She had carved out her own fortunes through a long period of eager struggle. She had done great things in building up a great new <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">France</place>; and just across the border, separated from her only by a few fortifications and a little country whose neutrality it has turned out the enemy did not respect, lay the shadow cast by the cloud which enveloped <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Germany</place>, the cloud of intrigue, the cloud of dark purpose, the cloud of sinister design. This shadow lay at the very borders of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">France</place>. And yet it is fine to remember, sir, that for <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">France</place> this was not only a peril but a challenge. <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">France</place> did not tremble. <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">France</place> waited and got ready, and it is a fine thing that though <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">France</place> quietly and in her own way prepared her sons for the struggle that was coming, she never took the initiative or did a single thing that was aggressive. She had prepared herself for defense, not in order to impose her will upon other peoples. She had prepared herself that no other people might impose its will upon her.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve"> As I stand with you and as I mix with the delightful people of this country I see this in their thoughts: “<place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> always was our friend. Now she understands. Now she comprehends; and now she has come to bring us this message, that understanding she will always be ready to help.” And, while, as you say, sir, this danger may prove to be a continuing danger, while it is true that <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">France</place> will always be nearest this threat, if we can not turn it from a threat into a promise, there are many elements that ought to reassure <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">France</place>. There is a new world, not ahead of us, but around us. The whole world is awake, and it is awake to its community of interest. It knows that its dearest interests are involved in its standing together for a common purpose. It knows that the perils of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">France</place>, if it continues, will be the peril of the world. It knows that not only <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">France</place> must organize against this peril, but that the world must organize against it.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">So I see in these welcomes not only hospitality, not only kindness, not only hope, but purpose, a definite, clearly defined purpose that men, understanding one another, must now support one another, and that all the sons of freedom are under a common oath to see that freedom never suffers this danger again. That to my mind is the impressive element of this welcome. I know how much of it, sir, and I know how little of it, to appropriate to myself. I know that I have the very distinguished honor to represent a nation whose heart is in this business, and I am proud to speak for the people whom I represent. But I know that you honor me in a representative capacity, and that my words have validity only in proportion as they are the words of the people of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place>. I delight in this welcome, therefore, as if I had brought the people of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> with me and they could see in your faces what I see—the tokens of welcome and affection.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve"> The sum of the whole matter is that <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">France</place> has earned and has won the brotherhood of the world. She has stood at the chief post of danger, and the thoughts of mankind and her brothers everywhere, her brothers in freedom, turn to her and center upon her. If this be true, as I believe it to be, <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">France</place> is fortunate to have suffered. She is fortunate to have proved her mettle as one of the champions of liberty, and she has tied to herself once and for all all those who love freedom and truly believe in the progress and rights of man.</p>

         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I consider it a distinguished privilege to be permitted to open the discussion in this conference on the league of nations. We have assembled for two purposes, to make the present settlements which have been rendered necessary by <word altform="World War I">this war</word>, and also to secure the peace of the world, not only by the present settlements but by the arrangements we shall make at this conference for its maintenance. The league of nations seems to me to be necessary for both of these purposes. There are many complicated questions connected with the present settlements which perhaps can not be successfully worked out to an ultimate issue by the decisions we shall arrive at here. I can easily conceive that many of these settlements will need subsequent reconsideration, that many of the decisions we make shall need subsequent alteration in some degree; for, if I may judge by my own study of some of these questions, they are not susceptible of confident judments at present.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">It is, therefore, necessary that we should set up some machinery by which the work of this conference should be rendered complete. We have assembled here for the purpose of doing very much more than making the present settlements. We are assembled under very peculiar conditions of world opinion. I may say without straining the point that we are not representatives of Governments, but representatives of peoples. It will not suffice to satisfy governmental circles anywhere. It is necessary that we should satisfy the opinion of mankind. The burdens of this war have fallen in an unusual degree upon the whole population of the countries involved. I do not need to draw for you the picture of how the burden has been thrown back from the front upon the older men, upon the women, upon the children, upon the homes of the civilized world, and how the real strain of the war has come where the eye of government could not reach, but where the heart of humanity beats. We are bidden by these people to make a peace to see to it that this strain does not come upon them again, and I venture to say that it has been possible for them to bear this strain because they hoped that those who represented them could get together after this war and make such another sacrifice unnecessary.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve"> It is a solemn obligation on our part, therefore, to make permanent arrangements that justice shall be rendered and peace maintained. This is the central object of our meeting. Settlements may be temporary, but the action of the nations in the interest of peace and justice must be permanent. We can set up permanent processes. We may not be able to set up permanent decisions. Therefore, it seems to me that we must take, so far as we can, a picture of the world into our minds. Is it not a startling circumstance, for one thing, that the great discoveries of science, that the quiet studies of men in laboratories, that the thoughtful developments which have taken place in quiet lecture rooms, have now been turned to the destruction of civilization? The powers of destruction have not so much multiplied as gained facility. The enemy whom we have just overcome had at his seats of learning some of the principal centers of scientific study and discovery, and he used them in order to make destruction sudden and complete; and only the watchful, continuous cooperation of men can see to it that science as well as armed men is kept within the harness of civilization.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">In a sense the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> is less interested in this subject than the other nations here assembled. With her great territory and her extensive sea borders, it is less likely that the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> should suffer from the attack of enemies than that many of the other nations here should suffer; and the ardor of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place>—for it is a very deep and genuine ardor—for the society of nations is not an ardor springing out of fear or apprehension, but an ardor springing out of the ideals which have come to consciousness in this war. In coming into this war the United States never for a moment thought that she was intervening in the politics of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Europe</place> or the politics of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Asia</place> or the politics of any part of the world. Her thought was that all the world had now become conscious that there was a single cause which turned upon the issues of this war. That was the cause of justice and of liberty for men of every kind and place. Therefore, the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> should feel that its part in this war had been played in vain if there ensued upon it merely a body of European settlements. It would feel that it could not take part in guaranteeing those European settlements unless that guaranty involved the continuous superintendence of the peace of the world by the associated nations of the world.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve"> Therefore, it seems to me that we must concert our best judgment in order to make this league of nations a vital thing—not merely a formal thing, not an occasional thing, not a thing sometimes called into life to meet an exigency, but always functioning in watchful attendance upon the interests of the nations—and that its continuity should be a vital continuity; that it should have functions that are continuing functions and that do not permit an intermission of its watchfulness and of its labor; that is should be the eye of the nations to keep watch upon the common interest, an eye that does not slumber, an eye that is everywhere watchful and attentive.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">And if we do not make it vital, what shall we do? We shall disappoint the expectations of the peoples. This is what their thought centers upon. I have had the very delightful experience of visiting several nations since I came to this side of the water, and every time the voice of the body of the people reache<supplied reason="editoriallyadded" cert="somedoubt">d</supplied> me through any representative, at the front of its plea stood the hope for the league of nations. Gentlemen, the select classes of mankind are no longer the governors of mankind. The fortunes of mankind are now in the hands of the plain people of the whole world. Satisfy them, and you have justified their confidence not only but established peace. Fail to satisfy them, and no arrangement that you can make will either set up or steady the peace of the world.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve"> You can imagine, gentlemen, I dare say, the sentiments and the purpose with which representatives of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> support this great project for a league of nations. We regard it as the keystone of the whole program which expressed our purposes and ideals in this war and which the associated nations have accepted as the basis of the settlement. If we returned to the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> without having made every effort in our power to realize this program, we should return to meet the merited scorn of our fellow citizens. For they are a body that constitutes a great democracy. They expect their leaders to speak their thoughts and no private purpose of their own. They expect their representatives to be their servants. We have no choice but to obey their mandate. But it is with the greatest enthusiasm and pleasure that we accept that mandate; and because this is the keystone of the whole fabric, we have pledged our every purpose to it, as we have to every item of the fabric. We would not dare abate a single part of the program which constitutes our instruction. We would not dare compromise upon any matter as the champion of this thing—this peace of the world, this attitude of justice, this principle that we are the masters of no people but are here to see that every people in the world shall choose its own masters and govern its own destinies, not as we wish but as it wishes. We are here to see, in short, that the very foundations of this war are swept away. Those foundations were the private choice of small coteries of civil rulers and military staffs. Those foundations were the aggression of great powers upon the small. Those foundations were the holding together of empires of unwilling subjects by the duress of arms. Those foundations were the power of small bodies of men to work their will upon mankind and use them as pawns in a game. And nothing less than the emancipation of the world from these things will accomplish peace. You can see that the representatives of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> are, therefore, never put to the embarrassment of choosing a way of expediency, because they have laid down for them the unalterable lines of principle. And, thank God, those lines have been accepted as the lines of settlement by all the high-minded men who have had to do with the beginnings of this great business.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I hope, <personRef refurl="x4004688" link-pointer-type="person" reg="Georges Clemenceau">Mr. Chairman</personRef>, that when it is known, as I feel confident it will be known, that we have adopted the principle of the league of nations and mean to work out that principle in effective action, we shall by that single thing have lifted a great part of the load of anxiety from the hearts of men everywhere. We stand in a peculiar case. As I go about the streets here I see everywhere the American uniform. Those men came into the war after we had uttered our purposes. They came as crusaders, not merely to win a war, but to win a cause; and I am responsible to them, for it fell to me to formulate the purposes for which I asked them to fight, and I, like them, must be a crusader for these things, whatever it costs and whatever it may be necessary to do, in honor, to accomplish the object for which they fought. I have been glad to find from day to day that there is no question of our standing alone in this matter, for there are champions of this cause upon every hand. I am merely avowing this in order that you may understand why, perhaps, it fell to us, who are disengaged from the politics of this great Continent and of the Orient, to suggest that this was the keystone of the arch and why it occurred to the generous mind of our president to call upon me to open this debate. It is not because we alone represent this idea, but because it is our privilege to associate ourselves with you in representing it.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I have only tried in what I have said to give you the fountains of the enthusiasm which is within us for this thing, for those fountains spring, it seems to me, from all the ancient wrongs and sympathies of mankind, and the very pulse of the world seems to beat to the surface in this enterprise.</p>

         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">You have not only done me a great honor, but you have touched me very much by this unexpected tribute; and may I add that you have frightened me? Because, realizing the great confidence you place in me, I am led to question my own ability to justify that confidence. You have not placed your confidence wrongly in my hopes and purposes, but perhaps not all of those hopes and purposes can be realized in the great matter that you have so much at heart, the right of women to take their full share in the political life of the nations to which they belong. That is necessarily a domestic question for the several nations. A conference of peace, settling the relations of nations with each other, would be regarded as going very much outside its province if it undertook to dictate to the several States what their internal policy should be.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">At the same time, those considerations apply also to conditions of labor, and it does seem to be likely that the conference will take some action by way of expressing its sentiments at any rate with regard to the international aspects at least of labor, and I should hope that some occasion might be offered for the case not only of the women of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">France</place> but of their sisters all over the world to be presented to the consideration of the conference. The conference is turning out to be a rather unwieldy body, a very large body, representing a great many nations, large and small, old and new, and the method of organizing its work successfully, I am afraid, will have to be worked out stage by stage. Therefore, I have no confident prediction to make as to the way in which it can take up questions of this sort.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">But what I have most at heart to-day is to avail myself of this opportunity to express my admiration for the women of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">France</place>, and my admiration for the women of all nations that have been engaged in <word altform="World War I">the war</word>. By the fortunes of this war the chief burden has fallen upon the women of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">France</place>, and they have borne it with a spirit and a devotion which has commanded the admiration of the world. I do not think that the people of France fully realize, perhaps, the intensity of sympathy that other nations have felt for them. They think of us in <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place>, for example, as a long way off, and we are in space, but we are not in thought. You must remember that the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> is made up of the nations of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Europe</place>; that French sympathies run straight across the seas, not merely by historic association but by blood connection; and that these nerves of sympathy are quick to transmit the impulses of the one nation to the other. We have followed your sufferings with a feeling that we were witnessing one of the most heroic and, may I add at the same time, satisfactory things in the world—satisfactory because it showed the strength of the human spirit, the indomitable power of women and men alike to sustain any burden if the cause was great enough. In an ordinary war there might have been some shrinking, some sinking of effort, but this was not an ordinary war. This was a war not only to redeem <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">France</place> from an enemy but to redeem the world from an enemy, and <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">France</place>, therefore, and the women of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">France</place>, strained their heart to sustain the world.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I hope that the strain has not been in vain. I know that it has not been in vain. This war has been peculiar and unlike other wars, in that it seemed sometimes as if the chief strain was behind the lines and not at the lines. It took so many men to conduct the war that the older men and the women at home had to carry the nation. Not only so, but the industries of the nation were almost as much part of the fighting as what actually took place at the fronts. So it is for that reason that I have said to those with whom I am at present associated that this must be a people’s peace, because this was a people’s war. The people won this war, not the governments, and the people must reap the benefits of the war. At every turn we must see to it that it is not an adjustment between governments merely, but an arrangement for the peace and security of men and women everywhere. The little, obscure sufferings and the daily unknown privations, the unspoken sufferings of the heart, are the tragical things of <supplied reason="editoriallyadded" cert="somedoubt">t</supplied>his war. They have been borne at home, and the center of the home is the woman. My heart goes out to you, therefore, ladies, in a very unusual degree, and I welcome this opportunity to bring you this message, not from myself merely, but from the great people whom I represent.</p>

The phrase “the rights of man” is somehow associated more intimately with the history of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">France</place> than with the history of any other country, and I think that the whole world has regarded France as a sort of pioneer in the ideal interpretation of that phrase. It was not an accident which drew <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">France</place> and the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> into close association. The <person refurl="x4000596" link-pointer-type="person" reg="Marquis de Lafayette">Marquis Lafayette</person> did not come to the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> because he alone entertained the sentiment of sympathy. He came, and we recognized that he came as a representative—shall I say, knight errant?—of the sympathy of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">France</place>; and when this opportunity came, not to repay our debt to <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">France</place>, for such debts are not repaid, but to show the similar sentiment that moved us and the equal willingness on our part to help <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">France</place> in her time of need, it was with genuine satisfaction that we came to help. It is true, sir, I believe, that our coming prevented a catastrophe that might have overwhelmed the world. That adds to our delight; that adds to our gratification that we could have served <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">France</place> in so exigent an hour.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Therefore, when you, who have through many difficulties represented an ideal principle, bring me these assurances of your friendship, it causes me an unusual emotion. I am grateful to you. I appreciate your homage and feel that it brings a message not only of friendly feeling but a message of comprehension and sympathy which is peculiarly delightful and acceptable.</p>

         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I appreciate very deeply what <person refurl="0" link-pointer-type="person">Mr. M—</person> has said, and I take it that his kind suggestion is that some time after my return we should arrange a public meeting at which I am quite confident, as I think he is, we may celebrate the completion of the work, at any rate up to a certain very far advanced state, the consummation of which we have been hoping for and working for for a long time. It would be a very happy thing if that could be arranged. I can only say for myself that I sincerely hope it can be. I should wish to lend any assistance possible to so happy a consummation.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I can not help thinking of how many miracles <word altform="World War I">this war</word> has already wrought—miracles of comprehension as to our interdependence as nations and as human beings; miracles as to the removal of the obstacles which seemed big and now have grown small, in the way of the active and organized cooperation of nations in regard to the establishment and maintenance of justice. And the thoughts of the people having been drawn together, there has already been created a force which is not only very great but very formidable, a force which can be rapidly mobilized, a force which is very effective when mobilized, namely, the moral force of the world. One advantage in seeing one another and talking with one another is to find that, after all, we all think the same way. We may try to put the result of the thing into different forms, but we start with the same principles.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I have often been thought of as a man more interested in principles than in practice, whereas, as a matter of fact, I can say that in one sense principles have never interested me. Because principles prove themselves when stated. They do not need any debate. The thing that is difficult and interesting is how to put them into practice. Large discourse is not possible on the principles, but large discourse is necessary on the matter of realizing them. So that, after all, principles until translated into practice are very thin and abstract and, I may add, uninteresting things. It is not interesting to have far-away visions, but it is interesting to have near-by visions, of what it is possible to accomplish; and in a meeting such as you are projecting perhaps we can record the success that we shall then have achieved, of putting a great principle into practice and demonstrated that it can be put into practice, though only, let us say five years ago, it was considered an impracticable dream.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I will cooperate with great happiness in the plans that you may form after my return, and I thank you very warmly for the compliment of this personal visit.</p>

         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">If there should arise between States members of the League any dispute likely to lead to a rupture, which is not submitted to arbitration as above, the High Contracting Parties agree that they will refer the matter to the Executive Council; either party to the dispute may give notice of the existence of the dispute to the Secretary-General, who will make all necessary arrangements for a full investigation and consideration thereof. For this purpose, the parties agree to communicate to the Secretary-General, as promptly as posssible, statements of their case with all the relevant facts and papers, and the Executive Council may forthwith direct the publication thereof.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Where the efforts of the Council lead to the settlement of the dispute, a statement shall be published indicating the nature of the dispute and the terms of settlement, together with such explanations as may be appropriate. If the dispute has not been settled, a report by the Council shall be published, setting forth with all necessary facts and explanations the recommendation which the Council think just and proper for the settlement of the dispute. If the report is unanimously agreed to by the members of the Council other than the parties to the dispute, the High Contracting Parties agree that they will not go to war with any party which complies with the recommendation and that, if any party shall refuse so to comply, the Council shall propose the measures necessary to give effect to the recommendation. If no such unanimous report can be made, it shall be the duty of the majority and the privilege of the minority to issue statements indicating what they believe to be the facts and containing the recommendations which they consider to be just and proper.<space dim="vertical" extent="2" units="em"/> </p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I pause to point out that a misconception might arise in connection with one of the sentences I have just read—“If any party shall refuse so to comply, the council shall propose the measures necessary to give effect to the recommendation.” A case in point, a purely hypothetical case, is this: Suppose that there is in the possession of a particular power a piece of territory or some other substantial thing in dispute to which it is claimed that it is not entitled. Suppose that the matter is submitted to the executive council for a recommendation as to the settlement of the dispute, diplomacy having failed; and suppose that the decision is in favor of the party which claims the subject matter of dispute as against the party which has the subject matter in dispute. Then, if the party in possession of the subject matter in dispute merely sits still and does nothing, it has accepted the decision of the council, in the sense that it makes no resistance; but something must be done to see that it surrenders the subject matter in dispute. In such a case, the only case contemplated, it is provided that the executive council may then consider what steps may be necessary to oblige the party against whom judgment has gone to comply with the decisions of the council.<space dim="vertical" extent="2" units="em"/> </p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The Executive Council may in any case under this Article refer the dispute to the Body of Delegates.

         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">To those colonies and territories which as a consequence of the late war have ceased to be under the sovereignty of the States which formerly governed them and which are inhabited by peoples not yet able to stand by themselves under the strenuous conditions of the modern world, there should be applied the principle that the well-being and development of such peoples form a sacred trust of civilization and that securities for the performance of this trust should be embodied in the constitution of the League.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The best method of giving practical effect to this principle is that the tutelage of such peoples should be entrusted to advanced nations who by reason of their resources, their experience or their geographical position, can best undertake this responsibility, and that this tutelage should be exercised by them as mandatories on behalf of the League.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The character of the mandate must differ according to the stage of the development of the people, the geographical situation of the territory, its economic conditions and other similar circumstances.</p>

         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Other peoples, especially those of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Central Africa</place>, are at such a stage that the mandatary must be responsible for the administration of the territory subject to conditions which will guarantee freedom of conscience or religion, subject only to the maintenance of public order and morals, the prohibition of abuses such as the slave trade, the arms traffic and liquor traffic, and the prevention of the establishment of fortifications or military and naval bases and of military training of the natives for other than police purposes and the defense of territory, and will also secure equal opportunitie<supplied reason="editoriallyadded" cert="somedoubt">s</supplied> for the trade and commerce of other members of the League.</p>

         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">It gives me pleasure to add to this formal reading of the result of our labors that the character of the discussion which occurred at the sittings of the commission was not only of the most constructive but of the most encouraging sort. It was obvious throughout our discussions that, although there were subjects upon which there were individual differences of judgment, with regard to the method by which our objects should be obtained, there was practically at no point any serious difference of opinion or motive as to the objects which we were seeking. Indeed, while these debates were not made the opportunity for the expression of enthusiasms and sentiments, I think the other members of the commission will agree with me that there was an undertone of high resolve and of enthusiasm for the thing we were trying to do, which was heartening throughout every meeting; because we felt that in a way this conference had entrusted to us the expression of one of its highest and most important purposes, to see to it that the concord of the world in the future with regard to the objects of justice should not be subject to doubt or uncertainty; that the cooperation of the great body of nations should be assured from the first in the maintenance of peace upon the terms of honor and of the strict regard for international obligation. The compulsion of that task was constantly upon us, and at no point was there shown the slightest desire to do anything but suggest the best means to accomplish that great object. There is very great significance, therefore, in the fact that the result was reached unanimously. Fourteen nations were represented, among them all of those powers which for convenience we have called the great powers, and among the rest a representation of the greatest variety of circumstance and interest. So that I think we are justified in saying that it was a representative group of the members of this great conference. The significance of the result, therefore, has that deepest of all meanings, the union of wills in a common purpose, a union of wills which can not be resisted, and which I dare say no nation will run the risk of attempting to resist.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Now, as to the character of the document. While it has consumed some time to read this document, I think you will see at once that it is, after all, very simple, and in nothing so simple as in the structure which it suggests for the league of nations—a body of delegates, an executive council, and a permanent secretariat. When it came to the question of determining the character of the representation in the body of delgates, we were all aware of a feeling which is current throughout the world. Inasmuch as I am stating it in the presence of official respresentatives of the various Governments here present, including myself, I may say that there is a universal feeling that the world can not rest satisfied with merely official guidance. There reached us through many channels the feeling that if the deliberative body of the league was merely to be a body of officials representing the various Governments, the peoples of the world would not be sure that some of the mistakes which preoccupied officials had admittedly made might not be repeated. It was impossible to conceive a method of an assembly so large and various as to be really representative of the great body of the peoples of the world, because, as I roughly reckon it, we represent as we sit around this table more than twelve hundred million people. You can not have a representative assembly of twelve hundred million people, but if you leave it to each Government to have, if it pleases, one or two or three representatives, though only a single vote, it may vary its representation from time to time, not only but it may originate the choice of its several representatives, if it should have several, in different ways. Therefore, we thought that this was a proper and a very prudent concession to the practically universal opinion of plain men everywhere that they wanted the door left open to a variety of representation instead of being confined to a single official body with which they might or might not find themselves in sympathy.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">And you will notice that this body has unlimited rights of discussion—I mean of discussion of anything that falls within the field of international relationship—and that it is specially agreed that war or international misunderstandings or anything that may lead to friction and trouble is everybody’s business, because it may affect the peace of the world. And in order to safeguard the popular power so far as we could of this representative body it is provided, you will notice, that when a subject is submitted, not to arbitration, but to discussion by the executive council, it can upon the initiative of either one of the parties to the dispute be drawn out of the executive council onto the larger forum of the general body of delegates, because throughout this instrument we are depending primarily and chiefly upon one great force, and that is the moral force of the public opinion of the world—the cleansing and clarifying and compelling influences of publicity—so that intrigues can no longer have their coverts, so that designs that are sinister can at any time be drawn into the open, so that those things that are destroyed by the light may be properly destroyed by the overwhelming light of the universal expression of the condemnation of the world.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Armed force is in the background in this program, but it <render rend="inherit" as="italic">is</render> in the background, and if the moral force of the world will not suffice, the physical force of the world shall. But that is the last resort, because this is intended as a constitution of peace, not as a league of war.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The simplicity of the document seems to me to be one of its chief virtues, because, speaking for myself, I was unable to foresee the variety of circumstances with which this league would have to deal. I was unable, therefore, to plan all the machinery that might be necessary to meet differing and unexpected contingencies. Therefore, I should say of this document that it is not a straitjacket, but a vehicle of life. A living thing is born, and we must see to it that the clothes we put upon it do not hamper it—a vehicle of power, but a vehicle in which power may be varied at the discretion of those who exercise it and in accordance with the changing circumstances of the time. And yet, while it is elastic, while it is general in its terms, it is definite in the one thing that we were called upon to make definite. It is a definite guarantee of peace. It is a definite guarantee by word against aggression. It is a definite guarantee against the things which have just come near bringing the whole structure of civilization into ruin. Its purposes do not for a moment lie vague. Its purposes are declared and its powers made unmistakable.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">It is not in contemplation that this should be merely a league to secure the peace of the world. It is a league which can be used for cooperation in any international matter. That is the significance of the provision introduced concerning labor. There are many ameliorations of labor conditions which can be affected by conference and discussion. I anticipate that there will be a very great usefulness in the bureau of labor which it is contemplated shall be set up by the league. While men and women and children who work have been in the background through long ages, and sometimes seemed to be forgotten, while Governments have had their watchful and suspicious eyes upon the maneuvers of one another, while the thought of statesmen has been about structural action and the large transactions of commerce and of finance, now, if I may believe the picture which I see, there comes into the foreground the great body of the laboring people of the world, the men and women and children upon whom the great burden of sustaining the world must from day to day fall, whether we wish it to do so or not; people who go to bed tired and wake up without the stimulation of lively hope. These people will be drawn into the field of international consultation and help, and will be among the wards of the combined Governments of the world. There is, I take leave to say, a very great step in advance in the mere conception of that.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Then, as you will notice, there is an imperative article concerning the publicity of all international agreements. Henceforth no member of the league can claim any agreement valid which it has not registered with the secretary general, in whose office, of course, it will be subject to the examination of anybody representing a member of the league. And the duty is laid upon the secretary general to publish every document of that sort at the earliest possible time. I suppose most persons who have not been conversant with the business of foreign offices do not realize how many hundreds of these agreements are made in a single year, and how difficult it might be to publish the more unimportant of them immediately—how uninteresting it would be to most of the world to publish them immediately—but even they must be published just so soon as it is possible for the secretary general to publish them.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Then there is a feature about this covenant which to my mind is one of the greatest and most satisfactory advances that have been made. We are done with annexations of helpless people, meant in some instances by some powers to be used merely for exploitation. We recognize in the most solemn manner that the helpless and undeveloped peoples of the world, being in that condition, put an obligation upon us to look after their interests primarily before we use them for our interest; and that in all cases of this sort hereafter it shall be the duty of the league to see that the nations who are assigned as the tutors and advisers and directors of these people shall look to their interest and to their development before they look to the interests and material desires of the mandatory nation itself. There has been no greater advance than this, gentlemen. If you look back upon the history of the world you will see how helpless peoples have too often been a prey to powers that had no conscience in the matter. It has been one of the many distressing revelations of recent years that the great power which has just been happily defeated put intolerable burdens and injustices upon the helpless people of some of the colonies which it annexed to itself; that its interest was rather their extermination than their development; that the desire was to possess their land for European purposes, and not to enjoy their confidence in order that mankind might be lifted in those places to the next higher level. Now, the world, expressing its conscience in law, says there is an end of that. Our consciences shall be applied to this thing. States will be picked out which have already shown that they can exercise a conscience in this matter, and under their tutelage the helpless peoples of the world will come into a new light and into a new hope.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">So I think I can say of this document that it is at one and the same time a practical document and a humane document. There is a pulse of sympathy in it. There is a compulsion of conscience throughout it. It is practical, and yet it is intended to purify, to rectify, to elevate. And I want to say that, so far as my observation instructs me, this is in one sense a belated document. I believe that the conscience of the world has long been prepared to express itself in some such way. We are not just now discovering our sympathy for these people and our interest in them. We are simply expressing it, for it has long been felt, and in the administration of the affairs of more than one of the great States represented here—so far as I know, of all the great States that are represented here—that humane impulse has already expressed itself in their dealings with their colonies whose peoples were yet at a low stage of civilization. We have had many instances of colonies lifted into the sphere of complete self-government. This is not the discovery of a principle. It is the universal application of a principle. It is the agreement of the great nations which have tried to live by these standards in their separate administrations to unite in seeing that their common force and their common thought and intelligence are lent to this great and humane enterprise. I think it is an occasion, therefore, for the most profound satisfaction that this humane decision should have been reached in a matter for which the world has long been waiting and until a very recent period thought that it was still too early to hope.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Many terrible things have come out of this war, gentlemen, but some very beautiful things have come out of it. Wrong has been defeated, but the rest of the world has been more conscious than it ever was before of the majesty of right. People that were suspicious of one another can now live as friends and comrades in a single family, and desire to do so. The miasma of distrust, of intrigue, is cleared away. Men are looking eye to eye and saying, “We are brothers and have a common purpose. We did not realize it before, but now we do realize it, and this is our covenenant of fraternity and of friendship.”</p>

         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I cannot leave <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">France</place> without expressing my profound sense of the generous hospitality of the French people and the French Government. They have received and treated me as I most desired to be treated- as a friend, a friend alike in spirit and in purpose. I am happy to think that I am to return to assist with all my heart in completing the just settlements which the Conference is seeking. And I shall carry with me during my absence very happy memories of the two months I have spent here.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I have been privileged to see near at hand what my sympathy had already conceived, the sufferings and problems of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">France</place>, and every day has deepened my interest in the solution of the grave questions upon whose proper solution the future prosperity of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">France</place> and of her associates and the whole world depends. May I not leave warm and affectionate farewell greetings.</p>

         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I wonder if you are half as glad to see me as I am to see you. It warms my heart to see a great body of my fellow citizens again because in some respects during recent months I have been very lonely, indeed, without your comradeship and counsel, and I tried at every step of the work which fell to me to recall what I was sure would be your counsel with regard to the great matters which were under consideration.</p>
         <p rend="center" xml:space="preserve"> <space dim="vertical" extent="2" units="em"/> <render as="smallcap" rend="inherit">greeting not personal.</render> <space dim="vertical" extent="2" units="em"/> </p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I do not want you to think that I have not been appreciative of the extraordinarily generous reception which was given me on the other side, in saying it makes me very happy to get home again. I do not mean to say I was not very deeply touched by the cries that came from greater crowds on the other side. But I want to say to you in all honesty, I felt them to be the call of greeting to you rather than to me. I did not feel that the greeting was personal. I had in my heart the overcrowning pride of being your representative and of receiving the plaudits of men everywhere who felt that your hearts beat with theirs in the cause of liberty. There was no mistaking the tone in the voices of these great crowds. It was not the tone of mere greeting, it was not the tone of mere generous welcome, it was the calling of comrade to comrade, the cry that comes from men who say we have waited for this day when the friends of liberty should come across the sea and shake hands with us to see that the new world was constructed upon a new basis and foundation of justice and right.</p>

         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I can not tell you the inspiration that came from the sentiments that came out of these simple voices of the crowd. And the proudest thing I have to report to you is that this great country of ours is trusted throughout the world. I have not come to report the proceedings or results of the proceedings of the peace conference—that would be premature. I can say that I have received very happy impressions from this conference, impressions that while there are many differences of judgment, while there are some divergencies of object, there is nevertheless a common spirit and a common realization of the necessity of setting up a new standard of right in the world. Because the men who are in conference in <place reg="Paris, France" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Paris</place> realize as keenly as any American can realize that they are not masters of their people, that they are servants of their people, and that the spirit of their people has awakened to a new purpose and a new conception of their power to realize that purpose, and that no man dare go home from that conference and report anything less noble than was expected of it.</p>

         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The conference seems to you to go slowly; from day to day in <place reg="Paris, France" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Paris</place> it seems to go slowly, but I wonder if you realize the complexity of the task which is undertaken. It seems as if the settlements of this war affect, and affect directly, every great, and I sometimes think every small, nation in the world. And no one decision can prudently be made which is not properly linked in with the great series of other decisions which must accompany it, and it must be reckoned in with the final result if the real quality and character of that result is to be properly judged.</p>
         <p rend="center" xml:space="preserve"> <space dim="vertical" extent="2" units="em"/> <render as="smallcap" rend="inherit">must hear all sides.</render> <space dim="vertical" extent="2" units="em"/> </p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">What we are doing is to hear the whole case, hear it from the mouths of men most interested, hear it from those who are officially commissioned to state it, hear the rival claims, hear the claims that affect new nationalities, that affect new areas of the world, that affect new commercial and economic connections that have been established by the great world war through which we have gone. And I have been struck by the moderateness of those who have represented national claims. I can testify that I have nowhere seen the gleam of passion. I have seen earnestness, I have seen tears come to the eyes of men who plead for downtrodden people whom they were privileged to speak for, but they were not tears of anger, they were tears of ardent hope; and I do not see how any man can fail to have been subdued by these pleas, subdued to this feeling that he was not there to assert an individual judgment of his own but to try to assist the cause of humanity.</p>
         <p rend="center" xml:space="preserve"> <space dim="vertical" extent="2" units="em"/> <render as="smallcap" rend="inherit">seek the united states.</render> <space dim="vertical" extent="2" units="em"/> </p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">And in the midst of it all every interest seeks out first of all when it reaches <place reg="Paris, France" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Paris</place> the representatives of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place>. Why? Because—and I think I am stating the most wonderful fact in history—because there is no nation in Europe that suspects the motives of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place>. Was there ever so wonderful a thing seen before? Was there ever so moving a thing? Was there ever any fact that so bound the Nation that had won that esteem forever to deserve it? I would not have you understand that the great men who represent the other nations there in conference are disesteemed by those who know them. Quite the contrary. But you understand that the nations of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Europe</place> have again and again clashed with one another in competitive interest. It is impossible for men to forget these sharp issues that were drawn between them in times past. It is impossible for men to believe that all ambitions have all of a sudden been foregone. They remember territory that was coveted, they remember rights it was attempted to extort, remember political ambitions which it was attempted to realize, and while they believe men have come into different temper they can not forget these things, and so they do not resort to one another for dispassionate view of matters in controversy.</p>
         <p rend="center" xml:space="preserve"> <space dim="vertical" extent="2" units="em"/> <render as="smallcap" rend="inherit">resort to friendly nation.</render> <space dim="vertical" extent="2" units="em"/> </p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">They resort to that nation which has won enviable distinction, being regarded as the friend of mankind. Whenever it is desired to send a small force of soldiers to occupy a piece of territory where it is thought nobody else will be welcome, they ask for American soldiers. And where other soldiers would be looked upon with suspicion and perhaps met with resistance, the American soldier is welcomed with acclaim. I have had so many grounds for pride on the other side of the water that I am very thankful that they are not grounds for personal pride, but for national pride.</p>
         <p rend="center" xml:space="preserve"> <space dim="vertical" extent="2" units="em"/> <render as="smallcap" rend="inherit">pride in the united states soldier.</render> <space dim="vertical" extent="2" units="em"/> </p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">If they were grounds for personal pride, I would be the most stuck-up man in the world. And it has been an infinite pleasure to me to see these gallant soldiers of ours, of whom the Constitution of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> made me the proud commander. Everybody praises the American soldier with the feeling that in praising him he is subtracting from the credit of no one else. I have been searching for the fundamental fact that converted <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Europe</place> to believe in us. Before this war Europe did not believe in us as she does now. She did not believe in us throughout the first three years of the war. She seems really to have believed that we were holding off because we thought we could make more by staying out than by going in. And all of a sudden, in short <word altform="eighteen">18</word> months, the whole verdict is reversed. There can be but one explanation for it. They saw what we did, that without making a single claim we put all our men and all our means at the disposal of those who were fighting for their homes in the first instance, but for the cause—the cause of human right and justice—and that we went in, not to support their national claims, but to support the great cause which they held in common. And when they saw that <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> not only held the ideals but acted the ideals, they were converted to <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> and became firm partisans of those ideals.</p>
         <p rend="center" xml:space="preserve"> <space dim="vertical" extent="2" units="em"/> <render as="smallcap" rend="inherit">the reflex of time.</render> <space dim="vertical" extent="2" units="em"/> </p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I met a group of scholars when I was in <place reg="Paris, France" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Paris</place>. Some gentlemen from one of the Greek universities who had come to see me and in whose presence, or rather in the presence of the traditions of learning, I felt very young, indeed. And I told them that I had had one of the delightful revenges that sometimes come to men. All my life I have heard men speak with a sort of condescension of ideals and of idealists, and particularly of those separated, encloistered persons whom they choose to term academic, who were in the habit of uttering ideals in a free atmosphere when they clash with nobody in particular. And I said I have had this sweet revenge. Speaking with perfect frankness in the name of the people of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> I have uttered as the objects of this great war ideals, and nothing but ideals, and the war has been won by that inspiration.</p>
         <p rend="center" xml:space="preserve"> <space dim="vertical" extent="2" units="em"/> <render as="smallcap" rend="inherit">change in fighting men.</render> <space dim="vertical" extent="2" units="em"/> </p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Men were fighting with tense muscle and lowered head until they came to realize those things, feeling they were fighting for their lives and their country, and when these accents of what it was all about reached them from <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> they lifted their heads, they raised their eyes to heaven, then they saw men in khaki coming across <supplied reason="editoriallyadded" cert="somedoubt">the</supplied> sea in <supplied reason="editoriallyadded" cert="somedoubt">the</supplied> spirit of crusaders, and they found these were strange men, reckless of danger not only, but reckless because they seemed to see something that made that danger worth while. Men have testified to me in <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Europe</place> that our men were possessed by something that they could only call religious fervor. They were not like any of the other soldiers. They had vision; they had dream, and they were fighting in dream; and fighting in dream they turned the whole tide of battle, and it never came back. And now do you realize that this confidence we have established throughout the world imposes a burden upon us—if you choose to call it a burden. It is one of those burdens which any nation ought to be proud to carry. Any man who resists the present tides that run in the world will find himself thrown upon a shore so high and barren that it will seem as if he had been separated from his human kind forever.</p>
         <p rend="center" xml:space="preserve"> <space dim="vertical" extent="2" units="em"/> <render as="smallcap" rend="inherit">the europe of to-day.</render> <space dim="vertical" extent="2" units="em"/> </p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve"><place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Europe</place> that I left the other day was full of something that it had never felt fill its heart so full before. It was full of hope. The <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Europe</place> of the second year of the war—the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Europe</place> of the third year of the war—was sinking to a sort of stubborn desperation. They did not see any great thing to be achieved even when the war should be won. They hoped there would be some salvage; they hoped they could clear their territories of invading armies; they hoped they could set up their homes and start their industries afresh. But they thought it would simply be a resumption of the old life that Europe had led—led in fear; led in anxiety; led in constant suspicion and watchfulness. They never dreamed that it would be a <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Europe</place> of settled peace and justified hope. And now these ideals have wrought this new magic that all the peoples of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Europe</place> are buoyed up and confident in the spirit of hope, because they believe that we are at the eve of a new age in the world, when nations will understand one another; when nations will support one another in every just cause; when nations will unite every moral and every physical strength to see that right shall prevail. If America were at this juncture to fail the world, what would come of it?</p>
         <p rend="center" xml:space="preserve"> <space dim="vertical" extent="2" units="em"/> <render as="smallcap" rend="inherit"><place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">america</place> hope of the world.</render> <space dim="vertical" extent="2" units="em"/> </p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I do not mean any disrespect to any other great people when I say that <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> is the hope of the world. And if she does not justify that hope results are unthinkable. Men will be thrown back upon bitterness of disappointment not only but bitterness of despair. All nations will be set up as hostile camps again; men at the peace conference will go home with their heads upon their breasts, knowing they have failed—for they were bidden not to come home from there until they did something more than sign the treaty of peace. Suppose we sign the treaty of peace and that it is the most satisfactory treaty of peace that the confusing elements of the modern world will afford and go home and think about our labors we will know that we have left written upon the historic table at <place reg="Versailles, France" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Versailles</place>, upon which <person refurl="0" link-pointer-type="person">Vergennes</person> and <person refurl="0" link-pointer-type="person">Benjamin Franklin</person> wrote their names, nothing but a modern scrap of paper, no nations united to defend it, no great forces combined to make it good, no assurance given to the downtrodden and fearful people of the world that they shall be safe. Any man who thinks that <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> will take part in giving the world any such rebuff and disappointment as that does not know <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place>. I invite him to test the sentiments of the Nation.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">We set this Nation up to make men free and we did not confine our conception and purpose to <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place>, and now we will make men free. If we did not do that all the fame of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> would be gone and all her power would be dissipated. She would then have to keep her power for those narrow, selfish, provincial purposes which seem so dear to some minds that have no sweep beyond the nearest horizon. I should welcome no sweeter challenge than that. I have fighting blood in me and it is sometimes a delight to let it have scope, but if it is challenged on this occasion it will be an indulgence. Think of the picture, think of the utter blackness that would fall on the world. <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> has failed. <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> made a little essay at generosity and then withdrew. <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> said, “We are your friends,” but it was only for to-day, not for to-morrow. <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> said, “Here is our power to vindicate right,” and then next day said, “Let right take care of itself and we will take care of ourselves.” <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> said, “We set up light to lead men along the paths of liberty, but we have lowered it—it is intended only to light our own path.”</p>
         <p rend="center" xml:space="preserve"> <space dim="vertical" extent="2" units="em"/> <render as="smallcap" rend="inherit">liberty, true and ideal.</render> <space dim="vertical" extent="2" units="em"/> </p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">We set up a great ideal of liberty, and then we said, “Liberty is a thing that you must win for yourself.” Do not call upon us and think of the world that we would leave. Do you realize how many new nations are going to be set up in the presence of old and powerful nations in <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Europe</place> and left there, there, if left by us, without a disinterested friend? Do you believe in the Polish cause as I do? Are you going to set up <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Poland</place>, immature, inexperienced, as yet unorganized, and leave her with a circle of armies around her? Do you believe in the aspirations of the <word altform="Czechoslovakians">Czecho-Slovaks</word> and <word>Jugo-Slavs</word> as I do? Do you know how many powers would be quick to pounce upon them if there were not guarantees of the world behind their liberty? Have you thought of the sufferings of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Armenia</place>? You poured out your money to help succor Armenians after they suffered. Now set up your strength so that they shall never suffer again.</p>
         <p rend="center" xml:space="preserve"> <space dim="vertical" extent="2" units="em"/> <render as="smallcap" rend="inherit">world peace to guarantee peace.</render> <space dim="vertical" extent="2" units="em"/> </p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Arrangements of the present peace can not stand a generation unless they are guaranteed by the united forces of the civilized world. And if we do not guarantee them can you not see the picture? Your hearts have instructed you where the burden of this war fell. It did not fall upon national treasuries; it did not fall upon the instruments of administration; it did not fall upon the resources of nations. It fell upon the voiceless homes everywhere, where women were toiling in hope that their men would come back. When I think of the homes upon which dull despair would settle if this great hope is disappointed, I should wish for my part never to have had <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> play any part whatever in this attempt to emancipate the world.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">But I talk as if there were any question. I have no more doubt of the verdict of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> in this matter than I have doubt of the blood that is in me. And so, my fellow citizens, I have come back to report progress, and I do not believe that progress is going to stop short of the goal. The nations of the world have set their heads now to do a great thing, and they are not going to slacken their purpose. And when I speak of the nations of the world I do not speak of the governments of the world. I speak of peoples who constitute the nations of the world. They are in the saddle, and they are going to see to it that if their present governments do not do their will some other governments shall. The secret is out, and present governments know it. There is a great deal of harmony to be got out of common knowledge.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">There is a great deal of sympathy to be got of living in the same atmosphere, and except for the differences of languages, which puzzled my American ear very sadly, I could have believed I was at home in <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">France</place> or <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Italy</place> or <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">England</place> when I was on the streets, when I was in the presence of crowds, when I was in great halls where men were gathered irrespective of class. I did not feel quite as much at home there as I do here, but I felt that now, at any rate after this storm of war had cleared the air men were seeing, eye to eye, everywhere and that these were the kind of folks who would understand what the kind of folks at home would understand; that they were thinking the same things.</p>
         <p rend="center" xml:space="preserve"> <space dim="vertical" extent="2" units="em"/> <render as="smallcap" rend="inherit">glad to “speak united states.”</render> <space dim="vertical" extent="2" units="em"/> </p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">It is a great comfort, for one thing, to realize that you all understand the language I am speaking. A friend of mine said that to talk through an interpreter was like witnessing the compound fracture of an idea. But the beauty of it is that whatever the impediments of the channel of communication the idea is the same, that it gets registered, and it gets registered in responsive hearts and receptive purposes. I have come back for a strenuous attempt to transact business for a little while in <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place>, but I have really come back to say to you, in all soberness and honesty, that I have been trying my best to speak your thoughts. When I sample myself I think I find that I am a typical American, and if I sample deep enough and get down to what probably is the true stuff of the men, then I have hope that it is part of the stuff that is like the other fellow’s at home. And, therefore, probing deep in my heart and trying to see things that are right without regard to the things that may be debated as expedient, I feel that I am interpreting the purpose and thought of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place>; and in loving <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> I find I have joined the great majority of my fellow men throughout the world.</p>

         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Address of <personRef refurl="x4000418" reg="Woodrow Wilson" link-pointer-type="person">the President</personRef> to the Democratic National Committee at Luncheon at the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">White House</place>, <date value="1919-02-28">February 28, 1919</date>.<space dim="vertical" extent="1" units="em"/></p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I cannot let this occasion go by without saying how very glad <person refurl="x4004687" reg="Edith Bolling Wilson" link-pointer-type="person">Mrs. Wilson</person> and I are to see you and how welcome it is to have a few words of conference with you - for we do not have time for more. I am glad that my return home coincided with your meeting so that this happy thing could occur. I have been saying to a great many that I never knew how good <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> felt until I got back to it, or how great a sacrifice it was to leave it. Because, of course, not only the natural intricacies of politics - local politics - center in <place reg="Paris, France" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Paris</place> at present, but all the intricacies of the politics of the world, and while there are many gyrations and complexities in our politics, I could not help feeling that the air was more wholesome on this side of the water than it was on the other.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">And yet I ought to hasten to say that I have acquired a real admiration for the men that we have been trying to cooperate with. They have many varied interests, they represent peoples who have sometimes had mighty little friendship for each other, and whom it is difficult to bring to a common agreement; and yet I think <sic corr="their">there</sic> sincere object is to bring about a common view and a settlement which will last because it is the right settlement as nearly as may be. I would not be doing them justice if I did not express the pleasure I have experienced in working with them and the pleasure I have received in coming in contact with their minds and the bodies of information and experience which they represent.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">But what I wanted to talk about a little was not what is happening on the other side, but rather the proper attitude of our own great party in this country. Personally, I am not the least discouraged by the results of the last Congressional election. Any party which carries out, through a long series of years, a great progressive and constructive program is sure to bring about a reaction, because while in the main the reforms that we have accomplished have been sound reforms, they have necessarily in the process of being made touched a great many definite interests in a way that distressed them, in a way that was counter to what they deemed their best and legitimate interest. So that there has been a process of adaptation in the process of change. There is nothing apparently to which the human mind is least hospitable than change, and in the business world that is particularly true because if you get in the habit of doing your business in a particular way and are compelled to do it in a different way, you think that somebody in <place reg="Washington, DC" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Washington</place> does not understand business, and, therefore, there has been a perfectly natural reaction against the changes we have made in the public policies of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place>. In many instances, as in the banking and currency reform, the country is entirely satisfied with the wisdom and permanency of the change, but even there a great many interests have been disappointed and many of their plans have been prevented from being consummated. So that there is that natural explanation. And then I do not think that we ought to conceal from ourselves the fact that <add>not</add> the whole body of our partisans are as cordial in the support of some of the things that we have done as they ought to be. You know, I heard a gentleman from one of the Southern States say to his Senator (this gentleman was himself a member of the State Legislature) - he said to his Senator: “We have the advantage over you because we have no publication corresponding with the Congressional Record and all that is recorded in our State is the vote, whereas the Congressional Record records all that happens <del status="unremarkable"><gap reason="illegible" extent="oneortwoword"/></del> <add>before</add> the vote; and while you have always voted right we know what happened in the meantime because we read the Congressional Record.” Now, with regard to a great many of our fellow-partisans in Congress, the Congressional Record shows what happened between the beginning of the discussion and the final vote, and our opponents were very busy in advertising what the Congressional Record disclosed. And to be perfectly plain, there was not in the minds of the country sufficiently satisfactory evidence that we had supported some of the great things that they were interested in any better than the other fellows. The voting record was all right and the balance in our favor, but they can show a great many things that discount the final record of the vote.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Now, I am in one sense an uncompromising partisan. Either a man must stand by his party or not. Either he has got to play the game or he has got to get out of the game, and I have no more sufferance for such a man than the country has, not a bit. Some of them got exactly what was coming to them and I haven’t any bowels of compassion for them. They did not support the things they pretended to support. And the country knew they didn’t - the country knew that the tone of the cloak-room and the tone of the voting were different tones. Now, I am perfectly willing to say that I think it is wise to judge of party loyalty by the cloak-room, and not by the vote, and the cloak-room was not satisfactory. I am not meaning to imply that there was any kind of blameworthy insincerity in this. I am not assessing individuals. That is not fair. But in assessing the cause of our defeat we ought to be perfectly frank and admit that the country was not any more sure of us than it ought to be. So that we have got to convince it that the ranks have closed up and that the man who constitute those ranks are all on the war-path and mean the things that they say and that the party professes. That is the main thing.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Now, I think <del status="unremarkable">wh</del><add>th</add>at can be accomplished by many processes. Unfortunately, the Members of Congress have to <del status="unremarkable"><gap reason="illegible" extent="oneortwoword"/></del> live in <place reg="Washington, DC" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Washington</place>, and <place reg="Washington, DC" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Washington</place> is not part of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place>. It is the most extraordinary thing I have ever known. If you stay here long enough you forget what the people of your own district are thinking about. There is one reason on the face of things. The wrong opinion is generally better organized than the right opinion. If some special interest has an impression that it wants to make on Congress it can get up thousands of letters with which to bombard its Senators and Representatives, and they get the impression that that is the opinion at home and they do not hear from the other fellows; and the consequence is that the unspoken and uninsisted-on views of the country, which are the views of the great majority, are not heard at this distance. If such an arrangement were feasible I think there ought to be a Constitutional provision that Congressmen and Senators ought to spend every other week at home and come back here and talk and vote after a fresh bath in the atmosphere of their home districts and the opinions of their home folks.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">But that brings me to what I wanted to speak of: The function of the National Committee not only, but of the State Committee<del status="unremarkable">,</del><add>s</add>, with which the National Committee is in touch. Surely it is the proper function to make the general body of opinion at home visible to the men who represent the district in Congress. They can do that without any offense, without seeming to try to dictate in any way by seeing to it that the real bodies of opinion are felt where action is taken. It is our present malady, you know, that Congress sits all the time. I call it a malady, not because it is in the least tiresome for me, but because it prevents the Members of Congress from getting into frequent contact with their constituents with these continuous sessions of Congress. Congress has been practically continuous ever since I came here and was continuous for six or eight years before that. In these circumstances party representatives owe it to their representatives in the House and the Senate to see to it <del status="unremarkable">they</del> <add>that</add> they are informed of the real opinion of the country. The other evening we had a dinner at which the <personRef refurl="x4000447" reg="Henry Cabot Lodge" link-pointer-type="person">senior Senator from Massachusetts</personRef> had the honor of sitting next to <person refurl="x4004687" reg="Edith Bolling Wilson" link-pointer-type="person">Mrs. Wilson</person>. Innocently she dwelt upon the magnificent reception we had gotten in <place reg="Boston, MA" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Boston</place>. And I think she was acting as I would wish the Committeemen to act - apprising their representatives innocently of the real state of opinion. And I understand that if not that at any rate something had <del status="unremarkable"><gap reason="illegible" extent="oneortwoword"/></del> <add>an</add> interesting effect upon the speech that was delivered today by the <personRef refurl="x4000447" reg="Henry Cabot Lodge" link-pointer-type="person">senior Senator from Massachusetts</personRef>. He was feeling around and suggested not so much that he was opposed to the League of Nations as that it might be in need of amendments - of bad amendmens as well as good amendments.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Now, the real issue of the day, gentlemen, is the League of Nations, and I was just saying to our colleagues who sit near me here that I think we must be very careful to serve the country in the right way with regard to that issue. We ought not, as I know you already feel from the character of the action you have just taken -- we ought not even to create the appearance of trying to make that a party issue. And I suggested this to <person refurl="x4000462" reg="Homer S. Cummings" link-pointer-type="person">Mr. Cummings</person> and the others who sat by me: I think it would be wise <del status="unremarkable">for</del> if the several National Committeemen were to get in touch with their State organizations upon returning home and suggest this course of action -- that the Democratic State organizations get into conference with the Republican State organizations and say to them: “Here is this great issue upon which the future peace of the world depends; it ought not to be made a party issue or to divide upon party lines; the country ought to support it regardless of party (as you stated in your resolution); now we propose to you that you pass resolutions supporting it, as we intend to do, and we will not anticipate you in the matter if you agree to that policy; let us stand back of it and not make a party issue of it.” Of course, if they decline, then it is perfectly legitimate, it seems to me, for the Democratic organization if it pleases to pass resolutions, framing these resolutions in as non-partisan language as is possible, but nevertheless doing what citizens ought to do in matters of this sort. But not without first making it a matter of party record that it has made these approaches to the Republican organizations and has proposed this similarity of action. In that way we accomplish a double object. We put it up to them to support the real opinion of their own people and we get instructed by the resolutions, and we find where the weak spots are and where the fighting has to be done for this great issue. Because, believe me, gentlemen, the civilized world cannot afford to have us lose this fight. I tried to state in <place reg="Boston, MA" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Boston</place> what it would mean to the people of the world if the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> did not support this great ideal with cordiality, but I was not able to speak when I tried to fully express my thoughts. I tell you, frankly, I choked up; I could not do it. The thing reaches the depth of tragedy. There is a sense in which I can see that the hope entertained by the people of the world with regard to us is a tragical hope - tragical in this sense, that it is so great, so far-reaching, it runs out to such depths that we cannot in the nature of things satisfy it. The world cannot go as fast in the direction of ideal results as th<del status="unremarkable">i</del><add>e</add>s<add>e</add> people believe the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> can carry them, and that is what makes me choke up when I try to talk about it - the consciousness of what they want us to do and of our relative inadequacy. And yet there is a great deal that we can do, and the immediate thing that we can do is to have an overwhelming national endorsement of this great plan. If we have that we will have settled most of the immediate political difficulties in <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Europe</place>. The present danger of the world - of course, I have to say this in the confidence of this company - but the present danger in this world is that the peoples of the world do not believe in their own governments. They believe these governments to be made up of the kind of men who have always run them, and who did not know how to keep them out of this war, did not know how to prepare them for war, and did not know how to settle international controversies in the past without making all sorts of compromising concessions. They do not believe in them, and, therefore, they have got to be buttressed by some outside power in which they do believe. Perhaps it would not do for them to examine us too narrowly. We are by no means su<del status="unremarkable">h</del><add>c</add>h ideal people as they believe us to be, but I can say that we are infinitely better than the others. We do purpose these things, we do purpose these great unselfish things; that is the glory of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place>, and if we can confirm that belief we have steadied the whole process of history in the immediate future; whereas if we do not confirm that belief I would not like to say what would happen in the way of utter dissolution of society.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The only thing that that ugly, poisonous thing called bolshevism feeds on is the doubt of the man on the street of the essential integrity of the people he is depending on to do his governing. That is what it feeds on. No man in his senses would think that a lot of local soviets could really run a government, but some of them are in a temper to have anything rather than the kind of thing they have been having; and they say to themselves: “Well, this may be bad but it is at least better and more immediately in touch with us than the other, and we will try it and see whether we cannot work something out of it.”</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">So that our immediate duty, not as Democrats, but as American citizens, is to concert the most powerful campaign that was ever concerted in this country in favor of supporting the League of Nations and to put it up to everybody - the Republican organizations and every other organization - to say where they stand, and to make a record and explain this thing to the people.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">In one sense it does not make any difference what the constitution of the League of Nations is. This present constitution in my judgment is a very conservative and sound document. There are some things in it which I would have phrased otherwise. I am modest enough to believe that the American draft was better than this, but it is the result of as honest work as I ever knew to be done. Here we sat around the table where there were representatives of fourteen nations. The five great powers, so-called, gave themselves two delegates apiece, and they allowed the other nine one delegate apiece. But it did not count by members - it counted by purpose.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">For example, among the rest was a man whom I have come to admire so much that I have come to have a personal affection for him, and that is <person refurl="x4005042" reg="Eleutherios Venizelos" link-pointer-type="person">Mr. Venizelos</person>, <sic corr="Prime">Prine</sic> Minister of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Greece</place>, as genuine a friend of man as ever lived and as able a friend of honest people ever had, and a man on whose face a glow comes when you state a great principle, and yet who is intensely practical and who was there to insist that nothing was to be done which put the small nations of the world at the disposal of the big nations. So that he was the most influential spokesman of what may be called the small powers as contrasted with the great. But I merely single him out for the pleasure of paying him this tribute, and not because the others were less earnest in pursuing their purpose. They were a body of men who all felt this. Indeed, several of them said <del status="unremarkable">it</del><add>this</add> to us: “The world expects not only, but demands of us that we shall do this thing successfully, and we cannot go away without doing it.” There is not a statesman in that conference who would dare go home saying that he had merely signed a treaty of peace no matter how excellent the terms of that treaty are, because he has received if not an official at least an influential mandate to see to it that something is done in addition which will make the thing stand after it is done; and he dare not go home without doing that. So that all around that table there was cooperation - generous cooperation of mind to make that document as good as we could make it. And I believe it is a thoroughly sound document. There is only one misleading sentence in it - only one sentence that conveys a wrong impression.  <del status="unremarkable">t</del><add>T</add>hat can<add>,</add> I dare say<add>,</add> be altered, though it is going to be extremely difficult to set up that fourteen-nation process again as will have to be done if any alteration is made.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The particular and most important thing to which every nation that joins the League agrees is this: That it won’t fight on any question at all <del status="unremarkable">which</del><add>until it</add> has done one of two things. If it is about a question that it considers suitable for arbitration it will submit it to arbitration. You know, <person refurl="x4005084" reg="William H. Taft" link-pointer-type="person">Mr. Taft</person> and other serious advocates of this general idea have tried to distinguish between justiciable and non-justiciable subjects, and while they have had more or less success with it, the success has not been satisfactory. You cannot define expressly the questions which nations would be willing to submit to arbitration. Some question of national pride may come in to upset the definition. So we said we would make them promise to submit every question that they considered suitable to arbitration and to abide by the result. If they do not regard it as suitable for arbitration they bind themselves to submit it to the consideration of the executive council for a period not exceeding six months, but they are not bound by the decision. It is an opinion, not a decision. But if a decision, a unanimous decision, is made, and one of the parties to the dispute accepts the decision, the other party does bind itself not to attack the party that accepts the opinion. Now in discussing that we saw this difficulty. Suppose that Power B is in possession of a piece of territory which Power A claims, and Power A wins its claims so far as the opinion of the executive council is concerned. And suppose that the power in possession of the territory accepts the decision but then simply stands pat and does nothing. It has got the territory. The other party, inasmuch as the party that has lost has accepted the decision, has <del status="unremarkable"><gap reason="illegible" extent="oneortwoword"/></del> bound itself not to attack it and cannot go by force of arms and take possession of the country. In order to cure that quandary we used a sentence which said that in case -- I have forgotten the phrase<del status="unremarkable">a</del><add>o</add>logy but it means this -- in case any power refuses to carry out the decision the executive council was to consider the means by which it could be enforced. Now that apparently applies to both parties but was intended to apply to the non-active party which refuses to carry it out. And that sentence is open to a misconstruction. The commission did not see that until after the report was made and I explained this to the general conference. I made an explanation which was substantially the same as I have made to you, and that this should be of record may be sufficient to interpret that phrase, but probably not. It is not part of the covenant and possibly an attempt ought to be made to alter it.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">But I am wandering from my real point. My point is th<del status="unremarkable">is</del><add>at</add> this is a workable beginning of a thing that the world insists on. There is no foundation for it except the good faith of the parties but there could not be any other foundation for an arrangement between nations.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The other night after dinner <person reg="Charles S. Thomas" link-pointer-type="person">Senator Thomas</person>, of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Colorado</place>, said: “Then after all it is not a guarantee of peace.” Certainly not. Who said that it was? If you can invent an actual guarantee of peace you will be a benefactor of mankind, but no such guarantee has been found. But this comes as near being a guarantee of peace as you can get.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I had this interesting experience when the Covenant was framed. I found that I was the only member of the committee who did not take it for granted that the members of the League would have the right to secede. I found there was a universal feeling that this treaty could be denounced in the usual way and that a State could withdraw. I demurred from that opinion and found myself in a minority of one, and I could not help saying to them that this would be very interesting on the other side of the water, that the only Southerner on this conference should deny the right of secession. But nevertheless it is instructive and interesting to learn that this is taken for granted; that it is not a covenant that you would have to continue to adhere to. I suppose that is a necessary assumption among sovereign states, but it would not be a very handsome thing to withdraw after we had entered upon it. The point is that it does rest upon the good faith of all the nations. Now the historic significance of it is this:</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">We are setting up right in the path that German ambition expected to tread a number of new states that, chiefly because of their newness, will for a long time be weak states. We are carving a piece of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Poland</place> out of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Germany’s</place> side; we are creating an independent <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Bohoemia</place> below that, an independent <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Hungary</place> below that, and enlarging <place reg="Romania" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Roumania</place>, and we are rearranging the territorial divisions of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Balkan States</place>. We are practically dissolving the empire of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Turkey</place> and setting up under mandatories of the League of Nations a number of states in <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Asia Minor</place> and <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Arabia</place> which, except for the power of the mandatories, would be almost helpless against any invading or aggressive force, and that is exactly the old <place reg="Berlin, Germany" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Berlin</place> to <place reg="Baghdad, Turkey (Iraq)" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Bagdad</place> route. So that when you remember that there is at present a strong desire on the part of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Austria</place> to unite with <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Germany</place>, you have the prospect of an industrial nation with seventy or eighty millions of people right in the heart of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Europe</place>, and to the Southeast of it nothing but weakness, unless it is supported by the combined power of the world.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Unless you expect this structure built at <place reg="Paris, France" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Paris</place> to be a house of <sic corr="cards">cardsm</sic> you have got to put into it the structural iron which will be afforded by the League of Nations. Take the history of the <abbr expan="World War I">war</abbr> that we have just been through. It is agreed by everybody that has expressed an opinion that if <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Germany</place> had known that <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">England</place> would go in, she never would have started. What do you suppose she would have done if she had known that everybody else would have gone in? Of course she would never <del status="unremarkable"><gap reason="illegible" extent="oneortwoword"/></del> have started. If she had known that the world would have been against her, this war would not have occurred; and the League of Nations gives notice that if anything of that sort is tried again, the world will be against the nation that tries it, and with that assurance given that such a nation will have to fight the world, you may be sure that whatever illicit ambitions a nation may have, it cannot and will not attempt to realize them. But if they have not that assurance and can in the meantime set up an infinite network of intrigue such as we now know ran like a honeycomb through the world, then any arrangement will be broken down. This is the place where intrigue did accomplish the disintegration which made the realization of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Germany’s</place> purposes almost possible. So that those people will have to make friends with their powerful neighbor <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Germany</place>, unless they have already made friends with all the rest of the world. So that we must have the League of Nations or else a repetition of the catastrophe we have just gone through.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Now if <del status="unremarkable">we</del> <add>you</add> put that case before the people of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> and show them that without the League of Nations, it is not worth while completing the treaty we are making in <place reg="Paris, France" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Paris</place>, then you have got an argument which even an unidealistic people would respond to, and ours is not an unidealistic people but the most idealistic people in the world. Just let them catch the meaning which really underlies this and there won’t be any doubt as to what the response will be from the hearts and from the judgments of the people of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place>.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I would hope, therefore, that forgetting elections for the time-being we should devote our thought and our energies and our plans to this great business, to concert bi-partisan and non-partisan action, and by whatever sort of action, to concert every effort in support of this thing. I cannot imagine an orator being afforded a better theme, so trot out your orators and turn them loose, because they will have an inspiration in this that they have never had before, and I would like to guarantee that the best vocabulary they can mobilize won’t be equal to the job. It surpasses past experience in the world and seems like a prospect of realizing what once seemed a remote hope of international morale. And you notice the basis of this thing. It guarantees the members of the League, guarantees to each their territorial integrity and political independence as against external aggression.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I found that all the other men a<del status="unremarkable">b</del><add>r</add>ound the conference table had a great respect for the right of revolution. We do not guarantee any State against what may happen <del status="unremarkable">except in</del> inside itself, but we do guarantee against aggression from the outside, so that the family can be as lively as it pleases, and we know what generally happens to an interloper if you interfere in a family quarrel. There was a very interesting respect for the right of revolution, may be because many of them thought it was nearer at hand than they had <sic corr="supposed">supposes</sic> and this immediate possibility breathed a respect in their minds. But whatever the reason was, they had a very great respect for it. I read the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Virginia</place> Bill of Rights very literally but not very elegantly to mean that any people is entitled to any kind of government it damn pleases, and that it is none of our business to suggest or to influence the kind that it is going to have. Sometimes it will have a very riotous form of government, but that is none of our business. And I find that that is accepted, even with regard to <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Russia</place>. Even conservative men like the representatives of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Great Britain</place> say it is not our business to dictate what kind of government <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Russia</place> shall have. The only thing to do is to see if we can help them by conference and suggestion and recognition of the right elements to get together and not leave the country in a state of chaos.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">It was for that reasonable purpose that we tried to have the conference at a place I had never heard of before - a place called <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Prinkipos</place>. I understand it is a place on the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Bosphorus</place> with fine summer hotels, etc., and I was abashed to admit that I had never heard of it - But having plenty of house room, we thought that we could get the several Russian elements together there and see if we could not get them to sit down in one room together and tell us what it was all about and what they intended to do. The Bolshevists had accepted, but had accepted in a way that was studiously insulting. They said they would come and were perfectly ready to say beforehand that they were ready to pay the foreign debt and ready to make concessions in economic matters, and that they were even ready to make territorial readjustments, which meant, “we are dealing with perjured governments whose only interest <del status="unremarkable">was</del> is in striking a bargain, and if that is the price of European recognition and cooperation, we are ready to pay it”.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I never saw anybody more angered than <person refurl="x4004689" reg="David Lloyd George" link-pointer-type="person">Mr. Lloyd George</person>, who said, “We cannot let that insult go by. We are not after their money or their concessions or their territory. That is not the point. We are their friends who want to help them and must tell them so”. We did not tell them so because to some of the people we had to deal with the payment of the foreign debt was a more interesting and important matter, but that will be made clear to them in conference, if they will believe it. But the Bolshevists, so far as we could get any taste of their flavor, are the most consummate sneaks in the world. I suppose because they know they have no high motives themselves, they do not believe that anybody else has. And <person refurl="x4000465" reg="Leon Trotsky" link-pointer-type="person">Trotsky</person>, having lived a few months in <place reg="New York, NY" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">New York</place>, was able to testify that the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> is in the hands of capitalists and does not serve anybody else’s interests but the capitalists’. And the worst of it is, I think he honestly believes it. It would not have much effect if he didn’t. Having received six dollars a week to write for a socialistic and anarchistic paper which believed that and printed it, and knowing how difficult it is to live on nothing but the wages of sin, he believes that the only wages paid here are the wages of sin.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">But we cannot rescue <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Russia</place> without having a united <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Europe</place>. One of my colleagues in <place reg="Paris, France" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Paris</place> said, We could not go home and say we had made peace if we left half of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Europe</place> and half of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Asia</place> at war - because <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Russia</place> constitutes half of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Europe</place> and <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Siberia</place> constitutes half of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Asia</place>. And yet we may have to go home without composing these great territories, but if we go home with a League of Nations, there will be some power to solve this most perplexing problem.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">And so from every point of view, it is obvious to the men in <place reg="Paris, France" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Paris</place>, obvious to those who in their own hearts are most indifferent to the League of Nations, that we have to tie in the provisions of the treaty with the League of Nations because the League of Nations is the heart of the treaty. It is the only machinery. It is the only solid basis of masonry that is in the treaty, and in saying that I know that I am expressing the opinion of all those with whom I have been conferring. I cannot imagine any greater historic glory <del status="unremarkable">than</del> for the party than to have it said that for the time being it is thinking not of elections, but of the salvation of the plain people of the world, and the plain people of the world are looking to us who call ourselves Democrats to prove to the utmost point of sacrifice that we are indeed democrats, with a small D as well as a large D, <del status="unremarkable">If</del><add>that</add> we are ready to put the whole power and influence of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> at the disposal of free men everywhere in the world no matter what the sacrifice involved, no matter what the danger to the cause.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">And I would like, if I am not tiresome, to leave this additional thought in your mind. I was one of the first advocates of the mandatory. I do not at all believe in handing over any more territory than has already been handed over to any sovereign. I do not believe in putting the people of the German territories at the disposition, unsubordinated disposition, of any great power, and therefore I was a warm advocate of the idea of <person refurl="x4000476" reg="Jan C. Smuts" link-pointer-type="person">General Smuts</person> - who by the way is an extraordinary person - who propounded the theory that the pieces of the Austro<del status="unremarkable">O</del><add>-</add>Hungarian Empires and the pieces of the Turkish Empire and the German colonies were all political units or territorial units which ought to be accepted in trust by the family of nations, and not turned over to any member of the family, and that therefore the League of Nations would have as one of its chief functions to act as Trustee for these great areas of dismembered empires. And yet the embarrassing moment came when they asked if the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> would be willing to accept a mandatory. I had to say offhand that it would not be willing. I have got to say off hand that in the present state of American opinion at any rate, it wants to <del status="unremarkable"><gap reason="illegible" extent="oneortwoword"/></del> observe what I may call without offence Pharisaical cleanliness and not take anything out of the pile. It is its point of pride that it does not want to seem to take anything, even by way of superintendence. And of course they said, That is very disappointing, for this reason (The reason they stated in as complimentary terms as I could have stated it myself): You would be the most acceptable mandatory to any one of these peoples, and very few of us, if any, would be acceptable. They said that in so many words, and it would greatly advance the peace of the world and the peace of mind of Europe if the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> would accept mandatories. I said, I am perfectly willing to go home and stump the country and see if they will do it, but I could not truthfully say off hand that they would, because I did not know.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Now what I wanted to suggest is this: Personally, and just within the limits of this room, I can say very frankly that I think we ought to. I think there is a very promising beginning in regard to countries like <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Armenia</place>. The whole heart of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> has been engaged for <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Armenia</place>. They know more about <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Armenia</place> and its sufferings than they know about any other European area; we have colleges out there; we have great missionary enterprises, just as we have had <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Robert College</place> in <place reg="Constantinople, Turkey" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Constantinople</place>. That is a part of the world where already American influence extends, a saving influence and an educating and an uplifting influence. Colleges like <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Beirut</place> in <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Syria</place> have spread their influence very much beyond the limits of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Syria</place>, all through the Arabian country and <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Mesopotamia</place> and in the distant parts of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Asia Minor</place>, and I am not without hope that the people of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> would find it acceptable to go in and be the trustee of the interests of the Armenian people and see to it that the unspeakable Turk and the almost equally difficult Kurd had their necks sat on long enough to teach them manners and give the industrious and earnest people of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Armenia</place> time to develop a country which is naturally rich with possibilities.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">But the place where they all want us to accept a mandate most is at <place reg="Constantinople, Turkey" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Constantinople</place>. I may say that it seems to be rather the consensus of opinion there that <place reg="Constantinople, Turkey" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Constantinople</place> ought to be internationalized. So that the present idea apparently is to delimit the territory around <place reg="Constantinople, Turkey" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Constantinople</place> to include the straits and set up a mandate for that territory which will make those straits open to the nations of the world without any conditions and make <place reg="Constantinople, Turkey" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Constantinople</place> truly international - an internationalized free city and a free port - and <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> is the only nation in the world that can undertake that mandate and have the rest of the world believe that it is undertaken in good faith that we do not mean to stay there and set up our own sovereignty. So that it would be a very serious matter for the confidence of the world in this treaty if the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> did not accept a mandate for <place reg="Constantinople, Turkey" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Constantinople</place>.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">What I have to suggest is that questions of that sort ought to be ventilated very thoroughly. This will appeal to the people of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place>: Are you going to take the advantages of this and not any of the burden? Are you going to put the burden on the bankrupt states of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Europe</place>? For almost all of them are bankrupt in the sense that they cannot undertake any new things. I think that will appeal to the American people: that they ought to take the burdens - for they are burdens. Nobody is going to get anything out of a mandatory of <place reg="Constantinople, Turkey" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Constantinople</place> or <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Armenia</place>. It is a work of disinterested philanthropy. And if you first present that idea and then make tentative expositions of where we might go in as a mandatory, I think that the people will respond. If we went in at <place reg="Constantinople, Turkey" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Constantinople</place>, for example, I think it is true that almost all the influential men who are prominent in the affairs of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Bulgaria</place> were graduates of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Robert College</place> and would be immediately susceptible to American interests. They would take American guidance when they would not take any other guidance.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">But I wish I could stay home and tackle this job with you. There is nothing I would like to do so much as to really say in parliamentary language what I think of the people that are opposing it. I would reserve the right in private to say in unparliamentary language what I think of them, but in public I would try to stick to parliamentary language. Because of all the blind and little provincial people, they are the littlest and most contemptible. It is not their character so much that I have a contempt for, though that contempt is thorough-going, but their minds. They have not got even good working imitations of minds. They remind me of a man with a head that is not a head but is just a kno<del status="unremarkable">w</del><add>t</add> providentially put there put there to keep him from ravelling out, but why the Lord should not have been willing to let them ravel out I do not know, because they are of no use, and if I could really say what I think about them, it would be picturesque. But the beauty of it is that their ignorance and their provincialism can be made so perfectly visible. They have horizons that do not go beyond their parish; they do not even reach to the edges of the parish, because the other people know more than they do. The whole impulse of the modern time is against them. They are going to have the most conspicuously contemptible names in history. The gibbets that they are going to be erected on by future historians will scrape the heavens, they will be so high. They won’t be turned in the direction of heaven at all, but they will be very tall, and I do not know any fate more terrible than to be exhibited in that future catalogue of the men who are utterly condemned by the whole spirit of humanity. If I did not despise them, I would be sorry for them.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Now I have sometimes a very cheering thought. On the <date value="1921-03-05">fifth of March, 1921</date>, I am going to begin to be a historian again instead of an active public man, and I am going to h<del status="unremarkable">v</del><add>a</add>ve the privilege of writing about these gentlemen without any restraints of propriety. The President, if my experience is a standard, is liable some day to bust by merely containing restrained gases. Anybody in the House or Senate can say any abusive thing he pleases about the President, but it shocks the sense of propriety of the whole country if the President says what he thinks about them. And that makes it very fortunate that the term of the President is limited, because no President could stand it for a number of years. But when the lid is off, I am going to resume my study of the dictionary to find adequate terms in which to describe the fatuity of these gentlemen with their poor little minds that never get anywhere but run around in a circle and think they are going somewhere. I cannot express my contempt for their intelligence, but because I think I know the people of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place>, I can predict their future with absolute certainty. I am not concerned as to the ultimate outcome of this thing at all, not for a moment, but I am concerned that the outcome should be brought about immediately, just as promptly as possible. So my hope is that we will all put on our war paint, not as Democrats but as Americans, get the true American pattern of war paint and a real hatchet and go out on the war path and get a collection of scalps that has never been excelled in the history of American warfare.</p>

         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I accept the intimation of the air just played (“Over There”). I will not come back “’till it’s over, over there.” And yet I pray God in the interests of <supplied reason="editoriallyadded" cert="somedoubt">the</supplied> peace of the world that that may be soon.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The first thing that I am going to tell the people on the other side of the water is that an overwhelming majority of the American people is in favor of the league of nations. I know that that is true. I have had unmistakable intimations of it from all parts of the country, and the voice rings true in every case. I account myself fortunate to speak here under the unusual circumstances of this evening. I am happy to associate myself with <person refurl="x4005084" link-pointer-type="person" reg="William H. Taft">Mr. Taft</person> in this great cause. He has displayed an elevation of view and devotion to public duty which is beyond praise.</p>

         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">And I am the more happy because this means that this is not a party issue. No party has a right to appropriate this issue and no party will in the long run dare oppose it.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">We have listened to so clear and admirable an exposition (<person refurl="x4005084" link-pointer-type="person" reg="William H. Taft">Mr. Taft’s</person> address preceding <personRef refurl="x4000418" link-pointer-type="person" reg="Woodrow Wilson">the President</personRef>) of many of the main features of the proposed covenant of the league of nations that it is perhaps not necessary for me to discuss in any particular way the contents of the document. I will seek rather to give you its setting. I do not know when I have been more impressed than by the conferences of the commission set up by the conference of peace to draw up the covenant for a league of nations. The representatives of <word altform="fourteen">14</word> nations sat around that board—not young men, not men inexperienced in the affairs of their own countries, not men inexperienced in the politics of the world—and the inspiring influence of every meeting was the concurrence of purpose on the part of all those men to come to an agreement and an effective working agreement with regard to this league of the civilized world.</p>

         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">There was a conviction in the whole impulse; there was conviction of more than one sort; there was the conviction that this thing ought to be done; and there was also the conviction that not a man there would venture to go home and say that he had not tried to do it.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve"><person refurl="x4005084" link-pointer-type="person" reg="William H. Taft">Mr. Taft</person> has set a picture for you of what failure of this great purpose would mean. We have been hearing for all these weary months that this agony of war has lasted of the sinister purpose of the central empires and we have made maps of the course that they meant their conquests to take. Where did the lines of that map lie, of that central line that we used to call from <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Bremen</place> to <place reg="Baghdad" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Bagdad</place>? They lay through these very regions to which <person refurl="x4005084" link-pointer-type="person" reg="William H. Taft">Mr. Taft</person> has called your attention, but they lay then through a united empire. The <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Austro-Hungarian Empire,</place> whose integrity <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Germany</place> was bound to respect as her ally, but they lay in the path of that line of conquest; the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Turkish Empire</place>, whose interests she professed to make her own, lay in the direct path that she intended to tread. And now what has happened? The <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Austro-Hungarian Empire</place> has gone to pieces and the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Turkish Empire</place> has disappeared, and the nations that effected that great result—for it was the result of liberation—are now responsible as the trustees of the assets of those great nations. You not only would have weak nations lying in this path but you would have nations in which that old poisonous seed of intrigue could be planted with the certainty that the crop would be abundant, and one of the things that the league of nations is intended to watch is the course of intrigue. Intrigue can not stand publicity, and if the league of nations were nothing but a great debating society it would kill intrigue.</p>
         <p rend="center" xml:space="preserve"> <space dim="vertical" extent="2" units="em"/> <render as="smallcap" rend="inherit">right of every member nation.</render> <space dim="vertical" extent="2" units="em"/> </p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">It is one of the agreements of this covenant that it is the friendly right of every nation a member of the league to call attention to anything that it thinks will disturb the peace of the world, no matter where that thing is occurring. There is no subject that may touch the peace of the world which is exempt from inquiry and discussion, and I think everybody here present will agree with me that <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Germany</place> would never have gone to war if she had permitted the world to discuss the aggression upon Serbia for a single week. The British foreign office pleaded that there might be a day or two delay so that representatives of the nations of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Europe</place> could get together and discuss the possibilities of a settlement. <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Germany</place> did not dare permit a day’s discussion. You know what happened. So soon as the world realized that an outlaw was at large the nations began, one by one, to draw together against her. We know for certainty that if <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Germany</place> had thought for a moment that <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Great Britain</place> would go in with <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">France</place> and <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Russia</place> she never would have undertaken the enterprise, and the league of nations is meant as notice to all outlaw nations that not only <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Great Britain</place> but the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> and the rest of the world will go in to check enterprises of that sort. And so the league of nations is nothing more nor less than the covenant that the world will always maintain the standards which it has now vindicated by some of the most precious blood ever spilt.</p>

It has not arisen in the councils of statesmen. <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Europe</place> is a bit sick at heart at this very moment because it sees that the statesmen have had no vision and that the only vision has been the vision of the people. Those who suffer see. Those against whom wrong is wrought know how desirable is the right of the righteous. Nations that have long been under the heel of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Austria</place>, that have long cowered before the German, that have long suffered the indescribable agonies of being governed by the Turk, have called out to the world generation after generation for justice, liberation, and succor, and no cabinet in the world has heard them. Private organizations, pitying hearts, philanthropic men and women, have poured out their treasure in order to relieve these sufferings, but no nation has said to the nations responsible, “You must stop; this thing is intolerable and we will not permit it.” And the vision has been with the people. My friends, I wish you would reflect upon this proposition; the vision as to what is necessary for great reforms has seldom come from the top in the nations of the world. It has come from the need and aspiration and self-assertion of great bodies of men who meant to be free. And I can explain some of the criticisms which have been leveled against this great enterprise only by the supposition that men who utter the criticisms have never felt the great pulse of the heart of the world.</p>

         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">And I want to utter this solemn warning, not in the way of a threat; the forces of the world do not threaten, they operate. The great tides of the world do not give notice that they are going to rise and run; they rise in their majesty and overwhelming might, and those who stand in the way are overwhelmed. Now the heart of the world is awake and the heart of the world must be satisfied. Do not let yourselves suppose for a moment that uneasiness in the populations of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Europe</place> is due entirely to economic causes or economic motives; something very much deeper underlies it all than that. They see that their governments have never been able to defend them against intrigue or aggression, and that there is no force of foresight or of prudence in any modern cabinet to stop war. And therefore they say “There must be some fundamental cause for this,” and the fundamental cause they are beginning to perceive to be that nations have stood singly or in little jealous groups against each other, fostering prejuduce, increasing the danger of war rather than concerting measures to prevent it; and that if there is right in the world, if there is justice in the world, there is no reason why nations should be divided in support of justice.</p>
         <p rend="center" xml:space="preserve"> <space dim="vertical" extent="2" units="em"/> <render as="smallcap" rend="inherit">world looking to the united states.</render> <space dim="vertical" extent="2" units="em"/> </p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">They are, therefore, saying if you really believe that there is a right, if you really believe that wars ought to be stopped, stop thinking about the rival interests of nations and think about men and women and children throughout the world. Nations are not made to afford distinction to their rulers by way of success in the maneuvers of politics; nations are meant, if they are meant for anything, to make the men, women, and children in them secure and happy and prosperous, and no nation has the right to set up its special interests against the interests and benefits of mankind, least of all this great Nation which we love. It was set up for the benefit of mankind; it was set up to illustrate the highest ideals and to achieve the highest aspirations of men who wanted to be free; and the world—the world of to-day—believes that and counts on us, and would be thrown back into the blackness of despair if we deserted it.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I have tried once and again, my fellow citizens, to say to little circles of friends or to larger bodies what seems to be the real hope of the peoples of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Europe</place>, and I tell you frankly I have not been able to do so, because when the thought tries to crowd itself into speech the profound emotion of the thing is too much; speech will not carry. I have felt the tragedy of the hope of those suffering peoples.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">It is a tragedy because it is a hope which can not be realized in its perfection; and yet I have felt besides its tragedy its compulsion, its compulsion upon every living man to exercise every influence that he has to the utmost to see that as little as possible of that hope is disappointed, because if men can not now, after this agony of bloody sweat, come to their self-possession and see how to regulate the affairs of the world we will sink back into a period of struggle in which there will be no hope and therefore no mercy. There can be no mercy where there is no hope, for why should you spare another if you yourself expect to perish? Why should you be pitiful if you can get no pity? Why should you be just if, upon every hand, you are put upon?</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">There is another thing which I think the critics of this covenant have not observed. They not only have not observed the temper of the world but they have not even observed the temper of those splendid boys in khaki that they sent across the seas. I have had the proud consciousness of the reflected glory of those boys because the Constitution made me their commander in chief, and they have taught me some lessons. When we went into the war we went into it on the basis of declarations which it was my privilege to utter because I believed them to be an interpretation of the purpose and thought of the people of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place>.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">And those boys went over there with the feeling that they were sacredly bound to the realization of those ideals; that they were not only going over there to beat Germany; they were not going over there merely with resentment in their hearts against a particular outlaw nation; but that they were crossing those 3,000 miles of sea in order to show <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Europe</place> that the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place>, when it became necessary, would go anywhere where the rights of mankind were threatened. They would not sit still in the trenches. They would not be restrained by the prudence of experienced continental commanders. They thought they had come over there to do a particular thing, and they were going to do it and do it at once. And just as soon as that rush of spirit as well as the rush of body came in contact with the lines of the enemy they began to break, and they continued to break until the end. They continued to break, my fellow citizens, not merely because of the physical force of those lusty youngsters but because of the irresistible spiritual force of the armies of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place>. It was that that they felt. It was that that awed them. It was that that made them feel if these youngsters ever got a foothold they could never be dislodged, and that therefore every foot of ground that they won was permanently won for the liberty of mankind.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">And do you suppose that, having felt that crusading spirit of these youngsters who went over there not to glorify <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> but to serve their fellow men, I am going to permit myself for one moment to slacken in my effort to be worthy of them and of their cause? What I said at the opening I said with a deeper meaning than perhaps you have caught; I do not mean to come back until its over over there, and it must not be over until the nations of the world are assured of the permanency of peace.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Gentlemen on this side of the water would be very much profited by getting into communication with some gentlemen on the other side of the water. We sometimes think, my fellow citizens, that the experienced statesmen of European nations are an unusually hardheaded set of men, by which we generally mean, although we do not admit it, they are a bit cynical; they say “This is a practical world,” by which you always mean that it is not an ideal world; that they do not believe things can be settled upon an ideal basis. Well, I never came into intimate contact with them before, but if they used to be that way they are not that way now. They have been subdued, if that was once their temper, by the awful significance of recent events and the awful importance of what is to ensue, and there is not one of them with whom I have come in contact who does not feel he can not in conscience return to his people from <place reg="Paris, France" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Paris</place> unless he has done his utmost to do something more than attach his name to a treaty of peace. Every man in that conference knows the treaty of peace in itself will be inoperative, as <person refurl="x4005084" link-pointer-type="person" reg="William H. Taft">Mr. Taft</person> has said, without this constant support and energy of a great organization such as is supplied by the league of nations.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">And men who, when I first went over there, were skeptical of the possibility of forming a league of nations, admitted that if we could but form it it would be an invaluable instrumentality through which to secure the operation of the various parts of the treaty; and when that treaty comes back gentlemen on this side will find the covenant not only in it, but so many threads of the treaty tied to the covenant that you can not dissect the covenant from the treaty without destroying the whole vital structure. The structure of peace will not be vital without the league of nations, and no man is going to bring back a cadaver with him.</p>
         <p rend="center" xml:space="preserve"> <space dim="vertical" extent="2" units="em"/> <render as="smallcap" rend="inherit">puzzle in some criticisms.</render> <space dim="vertical" extent="2" units="em"/> </p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I must say that I have been puzzled by some of the criticisms—not by the criticisms themselves—I can understand them perfectly even when there was no foundation for them—but by the fact of the criticism. I can not imagine how these gentlemen can live and not live in the atmosphere of the world. I can not imagine how they can live and not be in contact with the events of their times, and I particularly can not imagine how they can be Americans and set up a doctrine of careful selfishness thought out to the last detail. I have heard no counsel of generosity in their criticism. I have heard no constructive suggestion. I have heard nothing except “Will it not be dangerous to us to help the world?” It would be fatal to us not to help it.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">From being what I will venture to call the most famous and the most powerful nation in the world, we would of a sudden have become the most contemptible. So I did not need to be told, as I have been told, that the people of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> would support this covenant. I am an American and I knew they would. What a sweet revenge it is upon the world. They laughed at us once; they thought we did not mean our professions of principle. They thought so until <date value="1917-04-99">April of 1917</date>. It was hardly credible to them that we would do more than send a few men over and go through the forms of helping, and when they saw multitudes hastening across the sea, and saw what those multitudes were eager to do when they got to the other side, they stood at amaze and said “The thing is real; this nation is the friend of mankind as it said it was.” The enthusiasm, the hope, the trust, the confidence in the future bred by that change of view is indescribable. Take an individual American and you may often find him selfish and confined to his special interests; but take the American in the mass and he is willing to die for an ideal. The sweet revenge therefore is this, that we believed in righteousness and now we are ready to make the supreme sacrifice for it, the supreme sacrifice of throwing in our fortunes with the fortunes of men everywhere.</p>
         <p rend="center" xml:space="preserve"> <space dim="vertical" extent="2" units="em"/> <render as="smallcap" rend="inherit"><person refurl="x4000491" link-pointer-type="person" reg="George Washington">washington’s</person> words interpreted.</render> <space dim="vertical" extent="2" units="em"/> </p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve"><person refurl="x4005084" link-pointer-type="person" reg="William H. Taft">Mr. Taft</person> was speaking of <person refurl="x4000491" link-pointer-type="person" reg="George Washington">Washington’s</person> utterance about entangling alliances, and if he will permit me to say so, he put the exactly right interpretation upon what <person refurl="x4000491" link-pointer-type="person" reg="George Washington">Washington</person> said, the interpretation that is inevitable if you read what he said, as most of these gentlemen do not. And the thing that he longed for was just what we are now about to supply; an arrangement which will disentangle all the alliances in the world.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Nothing entangles, nothing enmeshes a man except a selfish combination with somebody else. Nothing entangles a nation, hampers it, binds it, except to enter into a combination with some other nation against the other nations of the world. And this great disentanglement of all alliances is now to be accomplished by this covenant, because one of the covenants is that no nation shall enter into any relationship wth another nation inconsistent with the covenants of the league of nations. Nations promise not to have alliances. Nations agree there shall be but one combination, and that is the combination of all against the wrongdoer.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">And so I am going back to my task on the other side with renewed vigor. I had not forgotten what the spirit of the American people is. But I have been immensely refreshed by coming in contact with it again. I did not know how good home felt until I got here.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The only place a man can feel at home is where nothing has to be explained to him. Nothing has to be explained to me in America, least of all the sentiment of the American people. I mean, about great fundamental things like this. There are many differences of judgment as to policy—and perfectly legitimate. Sometimes profound differences of judgment, but those are not differences of sentiment, those are not differences of purpose, those are not differences of ideals. And the advantage of not having to have anything explained to you is that you recognize a wrong explanation when you hear it.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">In a certain rather abandoned part of the frontier at one time it was said they found a man who told the truth; he was not found telling it, but he could tell it when he heard it. And I think I am in that situation with regard to some of the criticisms I have heard. They do not make any impression on me because I know there is no medium that will transmit them, that the sentiment of the country is proof against such narrowness and such selfishness as that. I commend these gentlemen to communion with their fellow citizens.</p>
         <p rend="center" xml:space="preserve"> <space dim="vertical" extent="2" units="em"/> <render as="smallcap" rend="inherit">confidence in the future.</render> <space dim="vertical" extent="2" units="em"/> </p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">What are we to say, then, as to the future? I think, my fellow citizens, that we can look forward to it with great confidence. I have heard cheering news since I came to this side of the water about the progress that is being made in <place reg="Paris, France" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Paris</place> toward the discussion and clarification of a great many difficult matters; and I believe settlements will begin to be made rather rapidly from this time on at those conferences. But what I believe—what I know as well as believe—is this: that the men engaged in those conferences are gathering heart as they go, not losing it; that they are finding community of purpose, community of ideal to an extent that perhaps they did not expect; and that amidst all the interplay of influence, there is a forward movement which is running toward the right. Men have at last perceived that the only permanent thing in the world is the right, and that a wrong settlement is bound to be a temporary settlement for the very best reason of all, that it ought to be a temporary settlement, and the spirits of men will rebel against it, and the spirits of men are now in the saddle.</p>
         <p rend="center" xml:space="preserve"> <space dim="vertical" extent="2" units="em"/> <render as="smallcap" rend="inherit">an incident in <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">italy</place>.</render> <space dim="vertical" extent="2" units="em"/> </p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">When I was in <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Italy</place>, a little limping group of wounded Italian soldiers sought an interview with me. I could not conjecture what it was they were going to say to me, and with the greatest simplicity, with touching simplicity, they presented me with a petition in favor of the league of nations.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Their wounded limbs, their impaired vitality, were the only argument they brought with them. It was a simple request that I lend all the influence that I might happen to have to relieve future generations of the sacrifices that they had been obliged to make. That appeal has remained in my mind as I have ridden along the streets in European capitals and heard cries of the crowd, cries for the league of nations from lips of people who, I venture to say, had no particular notion of how it was to be done, who were not ready to propose a plan for a league of nations, but whose hearts said that something by way of a combination of all men everywhere must come out of this. As we drove along country roads weak old women would come out and hold flowers to us. Why should they hold flowers up to strangers from across the Atlantic? Only because they believed that we were the messengers of friendship and of hope, and these flowers were their humble offerings of gratitude that friends from so great a distance should have brought them so great a hope.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">It is inconceivable that we should disappoint them, and we shall not. The day will come when men in <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> will look back with swelling hearts and rising pride that they should have been privileged to make the sacrifice which it was necessary to make in order to combine their might and their moral power with the cause of justice for men of every kind everywhere.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">God give us the strength and vision to do it wisely. God give us the privilege of knowing that we did it without counting the cost, and because we were true Americans, lovers of liberty and of right.</p>

         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">In view of certain misunderstandings which have arisen, it may be definitely stated that the American representatives in <place reg="Paris, France" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Paris</place> view with deep concern the delays attending the Peace settlement.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The wo<del status="unremarkable">l</del><add>r</add>ld is felt to be in a state of chaos. Unemployment in all countries exists to a greater degree than ever before in history. Slow starvation is gripping much of Europe. Su<del status="unremarkable">v</del><add>b</add>versive political doctrines are advancing alarmingly. Time is slipping by in discussion which all too slowly reach conclusions.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The past week has been particularly disappointing. Matters of immediate but of relatively minor importance have crowded out consideration of essentials. With every day has come up some new pr<del status="unremarkable">e</del><add>o</add>blem which demanded immediate <del status="unremarkable">attention</del> action to the exclusion of discussion of more basic principles. As a result it has not been possible to go to the heart of the crisis fast settling upon the world.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">It is felt that a radical change in method and attitude is essential i<del status="unremarkable">s</del><add>f</add> quick results are to be secured on a just basis. The broad humanitarian principles for which the war was waged must be again <del status="unremarkable">f</del><add>c</add>alled forth as a guide amidst the welter and confusion of detailed problems almost hopelessly complicated. E<del status="unremarkable">n</del><add>i</add>ther the nations must unite to help each other toward a resumption of normal life and relations <del status="unremarkable">are</del> or be overswept by disorganization, starvation and disaster. Every day’s delay makes the situation more precarious.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The world as it exists to-day is not the world of 191<del status="unremarkable">4</del><add>5</add>, 1916 and 1917. Decisions and agreements made under the conditions then prevailing are in many cases not now applicable. The whole face <del status="unremarkable">f</del><add>o</add>f the situation has changed before the havoc of war, the destruction of industry<add>,</add> and the threat of food shortage. If peace of any permanence is to be secured it must be based, not on the past, but on the present and the future.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The claims for strategic frontiers and national <sic corr="aggrandizement">aggrandisement</sic>, and the fear of disturbing national security, still exist, not so much as the official policy of the nations but rather as the guiding purpose of certain obstructionist groups in nearly all nations. In pressing what they believe to be their own immediate interests, they lose sight entirely of the fact that they are surely s<del status="unremarkable">e</del><add>o</add>wing the se<del status="unremarkable">d</del><add>e</add>ds of future wars rather than securing the safety which they profess to be seeking. It is time that public opinion in all countries isolated these obstructionist classes and endeavored to orientate its viewpoint in such a way as to see the future as well from the position of other nations as of their own.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">S<del status="unremarkable">ep</del><add>pe</add>cifically, as regards <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Germany</place>, it must be remembered that, whatever her past crimes, she is a nation of 70,000,000 highly organized people with<del status="unremarkable">i</del> whom the world must continue to live. At present slow starvation is spreading amongst her people in a way which if continued may full well lead to a state of chaos there which could hardly fail to drag the other nations into the vortex. As to her payment of reparation for the crimes she has committed, it must be obvious that she cannot be shut out of the markets of the world and at the same time make the huge payments which <del status="unremarkable">are</del> <add>will be</add> demanded of her. Either she must be allowed to produce and trade or her debtor nations must forego their reparations.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Still more specifically, it is essential to bring into being at the earliest possible moment a responsible organization which will guide the distracted affairs of the world. At the present moment the Peace Conference, at least in so far as its own states members are concerned, <del status="unremarkable">it</del> is acting as a <render as="underscore" rend="inherit">de</render> <render as="underscore" rend="inherit">facto</render> though not a <render as="underscore" rend="inherit">de</render> <render as="underscore" rend="inherit">jure</render> world government. It is directing the armies of states members, attempting to hold off wars threatened at many points of collision and serving in a sense as an international jury. It is inconceivable that there should be any interim between the ending o<del status="unremarkable">n</del><add>f</add> the peace conference and the operation of the League of Nations.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Practically every question in the Peace settlement will continue in one form or another after the signature of the treaty. The thousands of miles of boundaries to be laid down cannot all be settled at this moment. Boundary commissions must be established and plebescites held. The collection and <del status="unremarkable">repara-</del> distribution of reparations is a continuing function. Settlement of the question of responsibility for war and for violation of the laws of war will take years of examination. The carrying out of the peace terms, the overseeing of Germany’s military activities, the question of international labor, the problem of mandat<del status="unremarkable">a</del><add>o</add>ries, the international regime of ports, waterways and railways all carry on into the future and are problems which naturally fall within the sphere of the League of Nations.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The League Covenant is the most advanced <del status="unremarkable">part</del> of any part of the peace treaty. The original agreement, which was prepared largely when the m<del status="unremarkable">a</del><add>e</add>etings w<del status="unremarkable">he</del><add>er</add>e being held, was laid before the bar of world public opinion nearly five weeks ago, leaving the way wholly clear for the immediate matters of the Peace settlement.<ref refurl="e73850819190301123_1" link-pointer-type="Note"/> Within the past few days thirteen <del status="unremarkable"><gap reason="illegible" extent="oneortwoword"/></del> neutral nations have announced their acceptance of its principles while changes and improvements are being made so far as it is possible to make them under the infinitely complex conditions prevailing.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve"><del status="unremarkable">While</del> <add>With</add> the Covenant itself so far advanced it is essential to hasten the other pr<del status="unremarkable">i</del><add>o</add>blems of the German peace. The military, naval and air terms have been agreed upon with certain minor reservations. Unfor<del status="unremarkable">u</del><add>t</add>unately, however, other most vital problems are still unsettled, including the amount of reparation to be demanded and its method of distribution, the territorial frontiers of Germany on all sides, the question of responsibilities, and the economic future of Germany. It is hoped that in the ne<del status="unremarkable">a</del><add>x</add>t few days the respons<del status="unremarkable">b</del><add>i</add>ble statesmen will be able to concentrate unreservedly on these problems, examine them in the light of the existing serious realities, and by mutual sacrifices come <del status="unremarkable"><gap reason="illegible" extent="oneortwoword"/></del><add>t</add>o an agreement which will stand the strain of the forthcoming years.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">It is the American opinion, therefore, that there is a prime ne<del status="unremarkable">d</del><add>c</add>essity<del status="unremarkable"><gap reason="illegible" extent="oneortwoword"/></del><add>:</add> first, for a better union of all <del status="unremarkable">s</del><add>f</add>orces seeking a really just peace on the basis of the new world order now existing; second, for a more efficient concentration on the fundamental and still unsolved problems of the immediate peace settlement; and thirdly, for the quick completion for inclusion in the peace treaty of the League of Nations Covenant to assure international machinery to solve the infinitely complex and dangerous problems which will confront the world for years as an aftermath of the war.</p>

         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve"><render as="smallcap" rend="inherit">Gentlemen of the Congress</render>: I deeply regret my inability to be present at the opening of the extraordinary session of the Congress. It still seems to be my duty to take part in the counsels of the peace conference and contribute what I can to the solution of the innumerable questions to whose settlement it has had to address itself: for they are questions which affect the peace of the whole world and from them, therefore, the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> cannot stand apart. I deemed it my duty to call the Congress together at this time because it was not wise to postpone longer the provisions which must be made for the support of the government. Many of the appropriations which are absolutely necessary for the maintenance of the government and the fulfillment of its varied obligations for the fiscal year <date value="1919-99-99">1919</date>–<date value="1920-99-99">1920</date> have not yet been made; the end of the present fiscal year is at hand; and action upon these appropriations can no longer be prudently delayed. It is necessary, therefore, that I should immediately call your attention to this critical need. It is hardly necessary for me to urge that it may receive your prompt attention.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I shall take the liberty of addressing you on my return on the subjects which have most engrossed our attention and the attention of the world during these last anxious months, since the <date value="1918-11-11">armistice of last November</date> was signed, the international settlements which must form the subject matter of the present treaties of peace and of our national action in the immediate future. It would be premature to discuss them or to express a judgment about them before they are brought to their complete formulation by the agreements which are now being sought at the table of the conference. I shall hope to lay them before you in their many aspects so soon as arrangements have been reached.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I hesitate to venture any opinion or press any recommendation with regard to domestic legislation while absent from the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> and out of daily touch with intimate sources of information and counsel. I am conscious that I need, after so long an absence from <place reg="Washington, DC" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Washington</place>, to seek the advice of those who have remained in constant contact with domestic problems and who have known them close at hand from day to day; and I trust that it will very soon be possible for me to do so. But there are several questions pressing for consideration to which I feel that I may, and indeed must, even now direct your attention, if only in general terms. In speaking of them I shall, I dare say, be doing little more than speak your own thoughts. I hope that I shall speak your own judgment also.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The question which stands at the front of all others in every country amidst the present great awakening is the question of <word altform="labor">labour</word>; and perhaps I can speak of it with as great advantage while engrossed in the consideration of interests which affect all countries alike as I could at home and amidst the interests which naturally most affect my thought, because they are the interests of our own people.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">By the question of <word altform="labor">labour</word> I do not mean the question of efficient industrial production, the question of how <word altform="labor">labour</word> is to be obtained and made effective in the great process of sustaining populations and winning success amidst commercial and industrial rivalries. I mean that much greater and more vital question, how are the men and women who do the daily <word altform="labor">labour</word> of the world to obtain progressive improvement in the conditions of their <word altform="labor">labour</word>, to be made happier, and to be served better by the communities and the industries which their <word altform="labor">labour</word> sustains and advances? How are they to be given their right advantage as citizens and human beings?</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">We cannot go any further in our present direction. We have already gone too far. We cannot live our right life as a nation or achieve our proper success as an industrial community if capital and <word altform="labor">labour</word> are to continue to be antagonistic instead of being partners. If they are to continue to distrust one another and contrive how they can get the better of one another. Or, what perhaps amounts to the same thing, calculate by what form and degree of coercion they can manage or extort on the one hand work enough to make enterprise profitable, on the other justice and fair treatment enough to make life tolerable. That bad road has turned out a blind alley. It is no thoroughfare to real prosperity. We must find another, leading in another direction and to a very different destination. It must lead not merely to accomodation but also to a genuine cooperation and partnership based upon a real community of interest and participation in control.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">There is now in fact a real community of interest between capital and <word altform="labor">labour</word>, but it has never been made evident in action. It can be made operative and manifest only in a new organization of industry. The genius of our business men and the sound practical sense of our workers can certainly work such a partnership out when once they realize exactly what it is that they seek and sincerely adopt a common purpose with regard to it.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve"><word altform="labor">Labour</word> legislation lies, of course, chiefly with the states; but the new spirit and method of organization which must be effected are not to be brought about by legislation so much as by the common counsel and voluntary cooperation of capitalist, manager, and workman. Legislation can go only a very little way in commanding what shall be done. The organization of industry is a matter of corporate and individual initiative and of practical business arragement. Those who really desire a new relationship between capital and <word altform="labor">labour</word> can readily find a way to bring it about; and perhaps Federal legislation can help more than state legislation could.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The object of all reform in this essential matter must be the genuine democratization of industry, based upon a full recognition of the right of those who work, in whatever rank, to participate in some organic way in every decision which directly affects their welfare or the part they are to play in industry. Some positive legislation is practicable. The Congress has already shown the way to one reform which should be worldwide, by establishing the eight hour day as the standard day in every field of <word altform="labor">labour</word> over which it can exercise control. It has sought to find the way to prevent child <word altform="labor">labour</word>, and will, I hope and believe, presently find it. It has served the whole country by leading the way in developing the means of preserving and safeguarding life and health in dangerous industries. It can now help in the difficult task of giving a new form and spirit to industrial organization by coordinating the several agencies of conciliation and adjustment which have been brought into existence by the difficulties and mistaken policies of the present management of industry, and by setting up and developing new Federal agencies of advice and information which may serve as a clearing house for the best experiments and the best thought on this great matter, upon which every thinking man must be aware that the future development of society directly depends. Agencies of international counsel and suggestion are presently to be created in connection with the League of Nations in this very field; but it is national action and the enlightened policy of individuals, corporations, and societies within each nation that must bring about the actual reforms. The members of the committees on <word altform="labor">labour</word> in the two houses will hardly need suggestions from me as to what means they shall seek to make the Federal Government the agent of the whole nation in pointing out and, if need be, guiding the process of reorganization and reform.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I am sure that it is not necessary for me to remind you that there is one immediate and very practical question of <word altform="labor">labour</word> that we should meet in the most liberal spirit. We must see to it that our returning soldiers are assisted in every practicable way to find the places for which they are fitted in the daily work of the country. This can be done by developing and maintaining upon an adequate scale the admirable organization created by the Department of Labor for placing men seeking work; and it can also be done, in at least one very great field, by creating new opportunities for individual enterprise. The <personRef refurl="x4005191" reg="Franklin K. Lane" link-pointer-type="person">Secretary of the Interior</personRef> has pointed out the way by which returning soldiers may be helped to find and take up land in the hitherto undeveloped regions of the country which the Federal Government has already prepared or can readily prepare for cultivation and also on many of the cutover or neglected areas which lie within the limits of the older states; and I once more take the liberty of recommending very urgently that his plans shall receive the immediate and substantial support of the Congress.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Peculiar and very stimulating conditions await our commerce and industrial enterprise in the immediate future. Unusual opportunities will presently present themselves to our merchants and producers in foreign markets, and large fields for profitable investment will be opened to our free capital. But it is not only of that that I am thinking; it is not chiefly of that that I am thinking. Many great industries prostrated by the war wait to be rehabilitated, in many parts of the world where what will be lacking is not brains or willing hands or organizing capacity or experienced skill, but machinery and raw materials and capital. I believe that our business men, our merchants, our manufacturers, and our capitalists, will have the vision to see that prosperity in one part of the  world ministers to prosperity everywhere: that there is in a very true sense a solidarity of interest throughout the world of enterprise, and that our dealings with the countries that have need of our products and our money will teach them to deem us more than ever friends whose necessities we seek in the right way to serve.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Our new merchant ships, which have in some quarters been feared as destructive rivals, may prove helpful rivals, rather, and common servants, very much needed and very welcome. Our great shipyards, new and old, will be so opened to the use of the world that they will prove immensely serviceable to every maritime people in restoring, much more rapidly than would otherwise have been possible, the tonnage wantonly destroyed in the war. I have only to suggest that there are many points at which we can facilitate American enterpirse in foreign trade by opportune legislation and make it easy for American merchants to go where they will be welcomed as friends rather than as dreaded antagonists. <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> has a great and honorable service to perform in bringing the commerical and industrial undertakings of the world back to their old scope and swing again, and putting a solid structure of credit under them. All our legislation should be friendly to such plans and purposes.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">And credit and enterprise alike will be quickened by timely and helpful legislation with regard to taxation. I hope that the Congress will find it possible to undertake an early reconsideration of Federal taxes, in order to make our system of taxation more simple and easy of administration and the taxes themselves as little burdensome as they can be made and yet suffice to support the Government and meet all its obligations. The figures to which those obligations have arisen are very great indeed, but they are not so great as to make it difficult for the nation to meet them, and meet them, perhaps, in a single generation, by taxes which will neither crush nor discourage. These are not so great as they seem, not so great as the immense sums we have had to borrow, added to the immense sums we have had to raise by taxation, would seem to indicate; for a very large proportion of those sums were raised in order that they might be loaned to the governments with which we were associated in the war, and those loans will, of course, constitute assets, not liabilities, and will not have to be taken care of by our taxpayers.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The main thing we shall have to care for is that our taxation shall rest as lightly as possible on the productive resources of the country, that its rates shall be stable, and that it shall be constant in its revenue yielding power. We have found the main sources from which it must be drawn. I take it for granted that its mainstays will henceforth be the income tax, the excess profits tax, and the estate tax. All these can so be adjusted to yield constant and adequate returns and yet not constitute a too grievous burden on the taxpayer. A revision of the income tax has already been provided for by the act of <date value="1918-99-99">1918</date>, but I think you will find that further changes can be made to advantage both in the rates of the tax and in the method of its collection. The excess profits tax need not long be maintained at the rates which were necessary while the enormous expenses of the war had to be borne; but it should be made the basis of a permanent system which will reach undue profits without discouraging the enterprise and activity of our business men. The tax on inheritances ought, no doubt, to be reconsidered in its relation to the fiscal systems of the several states, but it certainly ought to remain a permanent part of the fiscal system of the Federal government also.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Many of the minor taxes provided for in the revenue legislation of <date value="1917-99-99">1917</date> and <date value="1918-99-99">1918</date>, though no doubt made necessary by the pressing necessities of the war time, can hardly find sufficient justification under the easier circumstances of peace, and now can happily be got rid of. Among these, I hope you will agree, are the excises upon various manufacturers and the taxes upon retail sales. They are unequal in the incidence on different industries and on different individuals. Their collection is difficult and expensive. Those which are levied upon articles sold at retail are largely evaded by the readjustment of retail prices. On the other hand, I should assume that it is expedient to maintain a considerable range of indirect taxes; and the fact that alcoholic liquors will presently no longer afford a source of revenue by taxation makes it the more necessary that the field should be carefully restudied in order that equivalent sources of revenue may be found which it will be legitimate, and not burdensome, to draw upon. But you have at hand in the Treasury Department many experts who can advise you upon the matters much better than I can. I can only suggest the lines of a permanent and workable system, and the placing of the taxes where they will least hamper the life of the people.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">There is, fortunately, no occasion for undertaking in the immediate future any general revision of our system of import duties. No serious danger of foreign competition now threatens American industries. Our country has emerged from the war less disturbed and less weakened than any of the European countries which are our competitors in manufacture. Their industrial establishments have been subjected to greater strain than ours, their <word altform="labor">labour</word> force to a more serious disorganization, and this is clearly not the time to seek an organized advantage. The work of mere reconstruction will, I am afraid, tax the capacity and the resources of their people for years to come. So far from there being any danger or need of accentuated foreign competition, it is likely that the conditions of the next few years will greatly facilitate the marketing of American manufactures abroad. Least of all should we depart from the policy adopted in the Tariff Act of <date value="1913-99-99">1913</date>, of permitting the free entry into the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> of the raw materials needed to supplement and enrich our own abundant supplies.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Nevertheless, there are parts of our tariff system which need prompt attention. The experiences of the war have made it plain that in some cases too great reliance on foreign supply is dangerous, and that in determining certain parts of our tariff policy domestic considerations must be borne in mind which are political as well as economic. Among the industries to which special consideration should be given is that of the manufacture of dyestuffs and related chemicals. Our complete dependence upon German supplies before the war made the interruption of trade a cause of exceptional economic disturbance. The close relation between the manufacturer of dyestuff, on the one hand, and of explosives and poisonous gases, on the other, moreover, has given the industry an exceptional signficance and value. Although the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> will gladly and unhesitatingly join in the <word altform="program">programme</word> of international disarmament, it will, nevertheless, be a policy of obvious prudence to make certain of the successful maintenance of many strong and well equipped chemical plants. The German chemical industry, with which we will be brought into competition, was and may well be again, a thoroughly knit monopoly capable of exercising a competition of a peculiarly insidious and dangerous kind.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> should, moreover, have the means of properly protecting itself whenever our trade is discriminated against by foreign nations, in order that we may be assured of that equality of treatment which we hope to accord and to promote the world over. Our tariff laws as they now stand provide no weapon of retaliation in case other governments should enact legislation unequal in its bearing on our products as compared with the products of other countries. Though we are as far as possible from desiring to enter upon any course of retaliation, we must frankly face the fact that hostile legislation by other nations is not beyond the range of possibility, and that it may have to be met by counter legislation. This subject, has, fortunately, been exhaustively investigated by the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> Tariff Commission. A recent report of that Commission has shown very clearly that we lack and that we ought to have the instruments necessary for the assurance of equal and equitable treatment. The attention of the Congress has been called to this matter on past occasions, and the past measures which are now recommended by the Tariff Commission are substantially the same that have been suggested by previous administrations. I recommend that this phase of the tariff question receive the early attention of the Congress.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Will you not permit me, turning from these matters, to speak once more and very earnestly of the proposed amendment to the Constitution which would extend the suffrage to women and which passed the House of Representatives at the last session of the Congress? It seems to me that every consideration of justice and of public advantage calls for the immediate adoption of that amendment and its submission forthwith to the legislatures of the several states. Throughout all the world this long delayed extension of the suffrage is looked for; in the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place>, longer, I believe, than anywhere else, the necessity for it, and the immense advantage of it to the national life, has been urged and debated, by women and men who saw the need for it and urged the policy of it when it required steadfast courage to be so much beforehand with the common conviction; and I, for once, covet for our country the distinction of being among the first to act in a great reform.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The telegraph and telephone lines will of course be returned to their owners so soon as the retransfer can be effected without administrative confusion, so soon, that is, as the change can be made with least possible inconvenience to the public and to the owners themselves. The railroads will be handed over to their owners at the end of the calendar year; if I were in immediate contact with the administrative questions which must govern the retransfer of the telegraph and telephone lines, I could name the exact date for their return also. Until I am in direct contact with the practical questions involved I can only suggest that in the case of the telegraphs and telephones, as in the case of the railways, it is clearly desirable in the public interest that some legislation should be considered which may tend to make of these indispensable instrumentalities of our modern life a uniform and coordinated system which will afford those who use them as complete and certain means of communication with all parts of the country as has so long been afforded by the postal system of the Government, and at rates as uniform and intelligible. Expert advice is, of course, available in this very practical matter, and the public interest is manifest. Neither the telegraph nor the telephone service of the country can be said to be in any sense a national system. There are many confusions and inconsistencies of rates. The scientific means by which communication by such instrumentalities could be rendered more thorough and satisfactory has not been made full use of. An exhaustive study of the whole question of electrical communication and of the means by which the central authority of the nation can be used to unify and improve it, if undertaken, by the appropriate committees of the Congress, would certainly result, indirectly even if not directly, in a great public benefit.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The demobilization of the military forces of the country has progressed to such a point that it seems to me entirely safe now to remove the ban upon the manufacture and sale of wines and beers, but I am advised that without further legislation I have not the legal authority to remove the present restrictions. I therefore recommend that the Act approved <date value="1918-11-21">November 21, 1918</date>, entitled, “An Act to enable the Secretary of Agriculture to carry out, during the fiscal year ending <date value="1919-06-30">June 30, 1919</date>, the purposes of the Act entitled ‘An Act to provide further for the national security and defense by stimulating agriculture and facilitating the distribution of agricultural products,’ and for other purposes,” be amended or repealed in so far as it applies to wines and beers.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I sincerely trust that I shall very soon be at my post in <place reg="Washington, DC" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Washington</place> again to report upon the matters which made my presence at the peace table apparently imperative, and to put myself at the service of the Congress in every matter of administration or counsel that may seem to demand executive action or advice.</p>

         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve"><personRef refurl="x4000419" reg="RaymondPoincare" link-pointer-type="person">Mr. President</personRef>;</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I thank you most sincerely for the words that you have uttered. I cannot pretend, sir, that the prospect of going home is not very delightful to me, but I can say with the greatest sincerity that the prospect of leaving <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">France</place> is very painful to me. I have received a peculiarly generous welcome here, and it has been pleasing for me to feel that the welcome was intended, not so much for myself as for the people whom I represented. And the people of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">France</place> know how to give a welcome that makes a man’s heart glad. They have a spontaneity about them, a simplicity of friendship which is altogether delightful.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I feel that my stay here, sir, has enlightened both my hear<del status="unremarkable">g</del><add>t</add> and my mind. It has enabled me personally to see the evidences of the suffering and sacrifices of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">France</place>. It has enabled me to come into personal touch with the leaders of the French people and through the medium of intercourse with them understand better, I hope, than I understood before the motives, the ambitions and the principles which actuate this great nation. It has, therefore, been to me a lesson in the roots of friendship, in those things which make the intercourse of nations profitable and serviceable for the rest of mankind.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Sometimes the work of the conference has seemed to go very slowly indeed, sometimes it has seemed as if there were unnecessary obstacles to agreement, but as the weeks have lengthened I have seemed to see the profit that came out of that. Quick conclusions would not have produced that intimate knowledge of each other’s mind which I think has come out of these daily conferences. We have been constantly in the presence of each other’s minds and motives and characters, and the comradeships which are based upon that sort of knowledge are sure to be very much more intelligent, not only, but to breed a much more intimate sympathy and comprehension than could otherwise be created. These six months have been months which have woven new fibers of connection between the hearts of our peoples. And something more than friendship and intimate sympathy has come out of this intercourse.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Friendship is a very great thing. Intimacy is a very enlightening thing. But friendship may end in sentiment. A new thing that has happened is that we have translated our common principles and our common purposes into a common plan. When we part, we are not going to part with a finished work, but with a work one portion of which is finished and the other portion of which is only begun. We have finished the formulation of the peace, but we have begun a plan of cooperation which I believe will broaden and strengthen as the years go by. So that this grip of the hand that we have taken now will not be relaxed. We shall continue to be comrades. We shall continue to be co-workers in tasks which, because they are common, will weave out of our sentiments a common conception of duty and a common conception of the rights of men of every race and of every clime. If it be true that that has been accomplished, it is a very great thing.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">As I go away from these scenes, I think I shall realize that I have been present at one of the most vital things that have happened in the history of nations. Nations have formed contracts with each other before, but they have never formed partnerships. They have associated themselves temporarily, but they have never before associated themselves permanently. The wrong that was done in the waging of this war was a great wrong, but it wakened the world to a great moral necessity of seeing that it was necessary that men should band themselves together in order that such a wrong should never be perpetrated again. Merely to beat a nation that was wrong once is not enough. There must follow the war<del status="unremarkable">m</del><add>n</add>ing to all other nations that would do like things that they in turn will be vanquished and shamed if they attempt a dishonorable purpose.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">You can see, therefore, sir, with what deep feelings those of us who must now for a little while turn away from <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">France</place> shall leave your shores; and though the ocean is broad, it will seem very narrow in the future. It will be easier to understand each other than it ever was before, and with the constant intercourse of cooperation, the understanding will strengthen into action, and action will itself educate alike our purpose and our thought. So, sir, in saying good-bye to <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">France</place>, I am only saying a sort of physical good-bye, not a spiritual good-bye. I shall retain in my heart always the warm feelings which the generous treatment of this great people has generated in my heart; and I wish in my turn, sir, to propose, as you have proposed, the continued and increasing friendship of the two nations, the safety and prosperity of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">France</place>, the closer and closer communion of free peoples, and the strengthening of every influence which instructs the mind and the purpose of humanity.</p>

         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve"><render as="smallcap" rend="inherit">Gentlemen of the Senate</render>: The treaty of peace with <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Germany</place> was signed at <place reg="Versailles, France" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Versailles</place> on the <date value="1919-06-28">twenty-eighth of June</date>. I avail myself of the earliest opportunity to lay the treaty before you for ratification and to inform you with regard to the work of the Conference by which that treaty was formulated.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The treaty constitutes nothing less than a world settlement. It would not be possible for me either to summarize or to construe its manifold provisions in an address which must of necessity be something less than a treatise. My services and all the information I possess will be at your disposal and at the disposal of your Committee on Foreign Relations at any time, either informally or in session, as you may prefer; and I hope that you will not hesitate to make use of them. I shall at this time, prior to your own study of the document, attempt only a general characterization of its scope and purpose.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">In one sense, no doubt, there is no need that I should report to you what was attempted and done at <place reg="Paris, France" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Paris</place>. You have been daily cognizant of what was going on there,—of the problems with which the Peace Conference had to deal and of the difficulty of laying down straight lines of settlement anywhere on a field on which the old lines of international relationship, and the new alike, followed so intricate a pattern and were for the most part cut so deep by historical circumstances which dominated action even where it would have been best to ignore or reverse them. The cross currents of politics and of interest must have been evident to you. It would be presuming in me to attempt to explain the questions which arose or the many diverse elements that entered into them. I shall attempt something less ambitious than that and more clearly suggested by my duty to report to the Congress the part it seemed necessary for my colleagues and me to play as the representatives of the Government of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place>.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">That part was dictated by the role <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> had played in the war and by the expectations that had been created in the minds of the peoples with whom we had associated ourselves in that great struggle.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> entered the war upon a different footing from every other nation except our associates on this side the sea. We entered it, not because our material interests were directly threatened or because any special treaty obligations to which we were parties had been violated, but only because we saw the supremacy, and even the validity, of right everywhere put in jeopardy and free government likely to be everywhere imperiled by the intolerable aggression of a power which respected neither right nor obligation and whose very system of government flouted the rights of the citizen as against the autocratic authority of his governors. And in the settlements of the peace we have sought no special reparation for ourselves, but only the restoration of right and the assurance of liberty everywhere that the effects of the settlement were to be felt. We entered the war as the disinterested champions of right and we interested ourselves in the terms of the peace in no other capacity.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The hopes of the nations allied against the central powers were at a very low ebb when our soldiers began to pour across the sea. There was everywhere amongst them, except in their stoutest spirits, a sombre foreboding of disaster. The war ended in <date value="1918-11-11">November</date>, eight months ago, but you have only to recall what was feared in midsummer last, four short months before the armistice, to realize what it was that our timely aid accomplished alike for their morale and their physical safety. That first, never-to-be-forgotten action at <place reg="Chateu-Thierry, France" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Chateau-Thierry</place> had already taken place. Our redoutable soldiers and marines had already closed the gap the enemy had succeeded in opening for their advance upon <place reg="Paris, France" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Paris</place>,—had already turned the tide of battle back towards the frontiers of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">France</place> and begun the rout that was to save <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Europe</place> and the world. Thereafter the Germans were to be always forced back, back, were never to thrust successfully forward again. And yet there was no confident hope. Anxious men and women, leading spirits of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">France</place>, attended the celebration of the fourth of July last year in <place reg="Paris, France" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Paris</place> out of generous courtesy,—with no heart for festivity, little zest for hope. But they came away with something new at their hearts: they have themselves told us so. The mere sight of our men,—of their <word altform="vigor">vigour</word>, of the confidence that showed itself in every movement of their stalwart figures and every turn of their swinging march, in their steady comprehending eyes and easy discipline, in the indomitable air that added spirit to everything they did,—made everyone who saw them that memorable day realize that something had happened that was much more than a mere incident in the fighting, something very different from the mere arrival of fresh troops. A great moral force had flung itself into the struggle. The fine physical force of those spirited men spoke of something more than bodily <word altform="vigor">vigour</word>. They carried the great ideals of a free people at their hearts and with that vision were unconquerable. Their very presence brought reassurance; their fighting made victory certain.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">They were recognized as crusaders, and as their thousands swelled to millions their strength was seen to mean salvation. And they were fit men to carry such a hope and make good the assurance it forecast. Finer men never went into battle; and their officers were worthy of them. This is not the occasion upon which to utter a eulogy of the armies <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> sent to <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">France</place>, but perhaps, since I am speaking of their mission, I may speak also of the pride I shared with every American who saw or dealt with them there. They were the sort of men <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> would wish to be represented by, the sort of men every American would wish to claim as fellowcountrymen and comrades in a great cause. They were terrible in battle, and gentle and helpful out of it, remembering the mothers and the sisters, the wives and the little children at home. They were free men under arms, not forgetting their ideals of duty in the midst of tasks of violence. I am proud to have had the privilege of being associated with them and of calling myself their leader.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">But I speak now of what they meant to the men by whose sides they fought and to the people with whom they mingled with such utter simplicity, as friends who asked only to be of service. They were for all the visible embodiment of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place>. What they did made <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> and all that she stood for a living reality in the thoughts not only of the people of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">France</place> but also of tens of millions of men and women throughout all the toiling nations of a world standing everywhere in peril of its freedom and of the loss of everything it held dear, in deadly fear that its bonds were never to be loosed, its hopes forever to be mocked and disappointed.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">And the compulsion of what they stood for was upon us who represented <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> at the peace table. It was our duty to see to it that every decision we took part in contributed, so far as we were able to influence it, to quiet the fears and realize the hopes of the peoples who had been living in that shadow, the nations that had come by our assistance to their freedom. It was our duty to do everything that it was within our power to do to make the triumph of freedom and of right a lasting triumph in the assurance of which men might everywhere live without fear.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Old entanglements of every kind stood in the way,—promises which Governments had made to one another in the days when might and right were confused and the power of the victor was without restraint. Engagements which contemplated any dispositions of territory, any extensions of sovereignty that might seem to be to the interest of those who had the power to insist upon them, had been entered into without thought of what the peoples concerned might wish or profit by; and these could not always be <word altform="honorably">honourably</word> brushed aside. It was not easy to graft the new order of ideas on the old, and some of the fruits of the grafting may, I fear, for a time be bitter. But, with very few exceptions, the men who sat with us at the peace table desired as sincerely as we did to get away from the bad influences, the illegitimate purposes, the demoralizing ambitions, the international counsels and expedients out of which the sinister designs of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Germany</place> had sprung as a natural growth.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">It had been our privilege to formulate the principles which were accepted as the basis of the peace, but they had been accepted, not because we had come in to hasten and assure the victory and insisted upon them, but because they were readily acceded to as the principles to which honourable and enlightened minds everywhere had been bred. They spoke the conscience of the world as well as the conscience of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place>, and I am happy to pay my tribute of respect and gratitude to the able, forward-looking men with whom it was my privilege to cooperate for their unfailing spirit of cooperation, their constant effort to accommodate the interests they represented to the principles we were all agreed upon. The difficulties, which were many, lay in the circumstances, not often in the men. Almost without exception the men who led had caught the true and full vision of the problem of peace as an indivisible whole, a problem, not of mere adjustments of interest, but of justice and right action.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The atmosphere in which the Conference worked seemed created, not by the ambitions of strong governments, but by the hopes and aspirations of small nations and of peoples hitherto under bondage to the power that victory had shattered and destroyed. Two great empires had been forced into political bankruptcy, and we were the receivers. Our task was not only to make peace with the central empires and remedy the wrongs their armies had done. The central empires had lived in open violation of many of the very rights for which the war had been fought, dominating alien peoples over whom they had no natural right to rule, enforcing, not obedience, but veritable bondage, exploiting those who were weak for the benefit of those who were masters and overlords only by force of arms. There could be no peace until the whole order of central <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Europe</place> was set right.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">That meant that new nations were to be created,—<place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Poland</place>, <place reg="Czechoslovakia" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Czecho-Slovakia</place>, <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Hungary</place> itself. No part of ancient <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Poland</place> had ever in any true sense become a part of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Germany</place>, or of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Austria</place>, or of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Russia</place>. <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Bohemia</place> was alien in every thought and hope to the monarchy of which she had so long been an artificial part; and the uneasy partnership between <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Austria</place> and <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Hungary</place> had been one rather of interest than of kinship or sympathy. The Slavs whom <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Austria</place> had chosen to force into her empire on the south were kept to their obedience by nothing but fear. Their hearts were with their kinsmen in the Balkans. These were all arrangements of power, not arrangements of natural union or association. It was the imperative task of those who would make peace and make it intelligently to establish a new order which would rest upon the free choice of peoples rather than upon the arbitrary authority of Hapsburgs or Hohenzollerns.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">More than that, great populations bound by sympathy and actual kin to <place reg="Romania" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Rumania</place> were also linked against their will to the conglomerate Austro-Hungarian monarchy or to other alien sovereignties, and it was part of the task of peace to make a new <place reg="Romania" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Rumania</place> as well as a new slavic state clustering about <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Serbia</place>.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">And no natural frontiers could be found to these new fields of adjustment and redemption. It was necessary to look constantly forward to other related tasks. The German colonies were to be disposed of. They had not been governed; they had been exploited merely, without thought of the interest or even the ordinary human rights of their inhabitants.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The <place reg="Ottoman Empire" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Turkish Empire</place>, moreover, had fallen apart, as the Austro-Hungarian had. It had never had any real unity. It had been held together only by pitiless, inhuman force. Its peoples cried aloud for release, for succour from unspeakable distress, for all that the new day of hope seemed at last to bring within its dawn. Peoples hitherto in utter darkness were to be led out into the same light and given at last a helping hand. Undeveloped peoples and peoples ready for recognition but not yet ready to assume the full responsibilities of statehood were to be given adequate guarantees of friendly protection, guidance, and assistance.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">And out of the execution of these great enterprises of liberty sprang opportunities to attempt what statesmen had never found the way before to do; an opportunity to throw safeguards about the rights of racial, national, and religious minorities by solemn international covenant; an opportunity to limit and regulate military establishments where they were most likely to be mischievous; an opportunity to effect a complete and systematic internationalization of waterways and railways which were necessary to the free economic life of more than one nation and to clear many of the normal channels of commerce of unfair obstructions of law or of privilege; and the very welcome opportunity to secure for <word altform="labor">labour</word> the concerted protection of definite international pledges of principle and practice.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">These were not tasks which the Conference looked about it to find and went out of its way to perform. They were inseparable from the settlements of peace. They were thrust upon it by circumstances which could not be overlooked. The war had created them. In all quarters of the world old established relationships had been disturbed or broken and affairs were at loose ends, needing to be mended or united again, but could not be made what they were before. They had to be set right by applying some uniform principle of justice or enlightened expediency. And they could not be adjusted by merely prescribing in a treaty what should be done. New states were to be set up which could not hope to live through their first period of weakness without assured support by the great nations that had consented to their creation and won for them their independence. Ill governed colonies could not be put in the hands of governments which were to act as trustees for their people and not as their masters if there was to be no common authority among the nations to which they were to be responsible in the execution of their trust. Future international conventions with regard to the control of waterways, with regard to illicit traffic of many kinds, in arms or in deadly drugs, or with regard to the adjustment of many varying international administrative arrangements could not be assured if the treaty were to provide no permanent common international agency, if its execution in such matters was to be left to the slow and uncertain processes of cooperation by ordinary methods of negotiation. If the Peace Conference itself was to be the end of cooperative authority and common counsel among the governments to which the world was looking to enforce justice and give pledges of an enduring settlement, regions like the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Saar basin</place> could not be put under a temporary administrative regime which did not involve a transfer of political sovereignty and which contemplated a final determination of its political connections by popular vote to be taken at a distant date; no free city like <place reg="Danzig, Poland" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Dantzig</place> could be created which was, under elaborate international guarantees, to accept exceptional obligations with regard to the use of its port and exceptional relations with a State of which it was not to form a part; properly safeguarded plebescites could not be provided for where populations were at some future date to make choice what sovereignty they would live under; no certain and uniform method of arbitration could be secured for the settlement of anticipated difficulties of final decision with regard to many matters dealt with in the treaty itself; the long-continued supervision of the task of reparation which <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Germany</place> was to undertake to complete within the next generation might entirely break down; the reconsideration and revision of administrative arrangements and restrictions which the treaty prescribed but which it was recognized might not prove of lasting advantage or entirely fair if too long enforced would be impracticable. The promises governments were making to one another about the way in which <word altform="labor">labour</word> was to be dealt with, by law not only but in fact as well, would remain a mere humane thesis if there was to be no common tribunal of opinion and judgment to which liberal statesmen could resort for the influences which alone might secure their redemption. A league of free nations had become a practical necessity. Examine the treaty of peace and you will find that everywhere throughout its manifold provisions its framers have felt obliged to turn to the League of Nations as an indispensable instrumentality for the maintenance of the new order it has been their purpose to set up in the world,—the world of civilized men.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">That there should be a league of nations to steady the counsels and maintain the peaceful understandings of the world, to make, not treaties alone, but the accepted principles of international law as well, the actual rule of conduct among the governments of the world, had been one of the agreements accepted from the first as the basis of peace with the central powers. The statesmen of all the belligerent countries were agreed that such a league must be created to sustain the settlements that were to be effected. But at first I think there was a feeling among some of them that, while it must be attempted, the formation of such a league was perhaps a counsel of perfection which practical men, long experienced in the world of affairs, must agree to very cautiously and with many misgivings. It was only as the difficult work of arranging an all but universal adjustment of the world’s affairs advanced from day to day from one stage of conference to another that it became evident to them that what they were seeking would be little more than something written upon paper, to be interpreted and applied by such methods as the chances of politics might make available if they did not provide a means of common counsel which all were obliged to accept, a common authority whose decisions would be recognized as decisions which all must respect.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">And so the most practical, the most skeptical among them turned more and more to the League as the authority through which international action was to be secured, the authority without which, as they had come to see it, it would be difficult to give assured effect either to this treaty or to any other international understanding upon which they were to depend for the maintenance of peace. The fact that the Covenant of the League was the first substantive part of the treaty to be worked out and agreed upon, while all else was in solution, helped to make the formulation of the rest easier. The Conference was, after all, not to be ephemeral. The concert of nations was to continue, under a definite Covenant which had been agreed upon and which all were convinced was workable. They could go forward with confidence to make arrangements intended to be permanent. The most practical of the conferees were at last the most ready to refer to the League of Nations the superintendence of all interests which did not admit of immediate determination, of all administrative problems which were to require a continuing oversight. What had seemed a counsel of perfection had come to seem a plain counsel of necessity. The League of Nations was the practical statesman’s hope of success in many of the most difficult things he was attempting.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">And it had validated itself in the thought of every member of the Conference as something much bigger, much greater every way, than a mere instrument for carrying out the provisions of a particular treaty. It was universally recognized that all the peoples of the world demanded of the Conference that it should create such a continuing concert of free nations as would make wars of aggression and spoliation such as this that has just ended forever impossible. A cry had gone out from every home in every stricken land from which sons and brothers and fathers had gone forth to the great sacrifice that such a sacrifice should never again be exacted. It was manifest why it had been exacted. It had been exacted because one nation desired dominion and other nations had known no means of defence except armaments and alliances. War had lain at the heart of every arrangement of the Europe,—of every arrangement of the world,—that preceded the war. Restive peoples had been told that fleets and armies, which they toiled to sustain, meant peace; and they now knew that they they had been lied to: that fleets and armies had been maintained to promote national ambitions and meant war. They knew that no old policy meant anything else but force, force,—always force. And they knew that it was intolerable. Every true heart in the world, and every enlightened judgment demanded that, at whatever cost of independent action, every government that took thought for its people or for justice or for ordered freedom should lend itself to a new purpose and utterly destroy the old order of international politics. Statesmen might see difficulties, but the people could see none and could brook no denial. A war in which they had been bled white to beat the terror that lay concealed in every Balance of Power must not end in a mere victory of arms and a new balance. The monster that had resorted to arms must be put in chains that could not be broken. The united power of free nations must put a stop to aggression, and the world must be given peace. If there was not the will or the intelligence to accomplish that now, there must be another and a final war and the world must be swept clean of every power that could renew the terror. The League of Nations was not merely an instrument to adjust and remedy old wrongs under a new treaty of peace; it was the only hope for mankind. Again and again had the demon of war been cast out of the house of the peoples and the house swept clean by a treaty of peace; only to prepare a time when he would enter in again with spirits worse than himself. The house must now be given a tenant who could hold it against all such. Convenient, indeed indispensable, as statesmen found the newly planned League of Nations to be for the execution of present plans of peace and reparation, they saw it in a new aspect before their work was finished. They saw it as the main object of the peace, as the only thing that could complete it or make it worth while. They saw it as the hope of the world, and that hope they did not dare to disappoint. Shall we or any other free people hesitate to accept this great duty? Dare we reject it and break the heart of the world?</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">And so the result of the Conference of Peace, so far as <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Germany</place> is concerned, stands complete. The difficulties encountered were very many. Sometimes they seemed insuperable. It was impossible to accommodate the interests of so great a body of nations,—interests which directly or indirectly affected almost every nation in the world,—without many minor compromises. The treaty, as a result, is not exactly what we would have written. It is probably not what any one of the national delegations would have written. But results were worked out which on the whole bear test. I think that it will be found that the compromises which were accepted as inevitable nowhere cut to the heart of any principle. The work of the Conference squares, as a whole, with the principles agreed upon as the basis of the peace as well as with the practical possibilities of the international situations which had to be faced and dealt with as facts.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I shall presently have occasion to lay before you a special treaty with <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">France</place>, whose object is the temporary protection of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">France</place> from unprovoked aggression by the Power with whom this treaty of peace has been negotiated. Its terms link it with this treaty. I take the liberty, however, of reserving it for special explication on another occasion.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The rôle which <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> was to play in the Conference seemed determined, as I have said, before my colleagues and I got to Paris,—determined by the universal expectations of the nations whose representatives, drawn from all quarters of the globe, we were to deal with. It was universally recognized that <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> had entered the war to promote no private or peculiar interest of her own but only as the champion of rights which she was glad to share with free men and lovers of justice everywhere. We had formulated the principles upon which the settlement was to be made,—the principles upon which the armistice had been agreed to and the parleys of peace undertaken,—and no one doubted that our desire was to see the treaty of peace formulated along the actual lines of those principles,—and desired nothing else. We were welcomed as disinterested friends. We were resorted to as arbiters in many a difficult matter. It was recognized that our material aid would be indispensable in the days to come, when industry and credit would have to be brought back to their normal operation again and communities beaten to the ground assisted to their feet once more, and it was taken for granted, I am proud to say, that we would play the helpful friend in these things as in all others without prejudice or favour. We were generously accepted as the unaffected champions of what was right. It was a very responsible rôle to play; but I am happy to report that the fine group of Americans who helped with their expert advice in each part of the varied settlements sought in every transaction to justify the high confidence reposed in them.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">And that confidence, it seems to me, is the measure of our opportunity and of our duty in the days to come, in which the new hope of the peoples of the world is to be fulfilled or disappointed. The fact that <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> is the friend of the nations, whether they be rivals or associates, is no new fact: it is only the discovery of it by the rest of the world that is new.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve"><place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> may be said to have just reached her majority as a world power. It was almost exactly twenty-one years ago that the results of the war with <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Spain</place> put us unexpectedly in possession of rich islands on the other side of the world and brought us into association with other governments in the control of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">West Indies</place>. It was regarded as a sinister and ominous thing by the statesmen of more than one European chancellery that we should have extended our power beyond the confines of our continental dominions. They were accustomed to think of new <word altform="neighbors">neighbours</word> as a new menace, of rivals as watchful enemies. There were persons amongst us at home who looked with deep disapproval and avowed anxiety on such extensions of our national authority over distant islands and over peoples whom they feared we might exploit, not serve and assist. But we have not exploited them. We have been their friends and have sought to serve them. And our dominion has been a menace to no other nation. We redeemed our <word altform="honor">honour</word> to the utmost in our dealings with <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Cuba</place>. She is weak but absolutely free; and it is her trust in us that makes her free. Weak peoples everywhere stand ready to give us any authority among them that will assure them a like friendly oversight and direction. They know that there is no ground for fear in receiving us as their mentors and guides. Our isolation was ended twenty years ago; and now fear of us is ended also, our counsel and association sought after and desired. There can be no question of our ceasing to be a world power. The only question is whether we can refuse the moral leadership that is offered us, whether we shall accept or reject the confidence of the world.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The war and the Conference of Peace now sitting in <place reg="Paris, France" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Paris</place> seem to me to have answered that question. Our participation in the war established our position among the nations and nothing but our own mistaken action can alter it. It was not an accident or a matter of sudden choice that we are no longer isolated and devoted to a policy which has only our own interest and advantage for its object. It was our duty to go in, if we were indeed the champions of liberty and of right. We answered to the call of duty in a way so spirited, so utterly without thought of what we spent of blood or treasure, so effective, so worthy of the admiration of true men everywhere, so wrought out of the stuff of all that was heroic, that the whole world saw at last, in the flesh, in noble action, a great ideal asserted and vindicated, by a nation they had deemed material and now found to be compact of the spiritual forces that must free men of every nation from every unworthy bondage. It is thus that a new role and a new responsibility have come to this great nation that we <word altform="honor">honour</word> and which we would all wish to lift to yet higher levels of service and achievement.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The stage is set, the destiny disclosed. It has come about by no plan of our conceiving, but by the hand of God who led us into this way. We cannot turn back. We can only go forward, with lifted eyes and freshened spirit, to follow the vision. It was of this that we dreamed at our birth. <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> shall in truth show the way. The light streams upon the path ahead, and nowhere else.</p>

         <p rend="noindent" xml:space="preserve"><render as="smallcap" rend="inherit">Gentlemen of the Congress</render>:</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I have sought this opportunity to address you because it is clearly my duty to call your attention to the present cost of living and to urge upon you with all the persuasive force of which I am capable the legislative measures which would be most effective in controlling it and bringing it down. The prices the people of this country are paying for everything that it is necessary for them to use in order to live are not justified by a shortage in supply, either present or prospective, and are in many cases artificially and deliberately created by vicious practices which ought immediately to be checked by law. They constitute a burden upon us which is the more unbearable because we know that it is wilfully imposed by those who have the power and that it can by <word altform="vigorous">vigourous</word> public action be greatly lightened and made to square with the actual conditions of supply and demand. Some of the methods by which these prices are produced are already illegal, some of them criminal, and those who employ them will be energetically proceeded against; but others have not yet been brought under the law, and should be dealt with at once by legislation.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I need not recite the particulars of this critical matter: the prices demanded and paid at the sources of supply, at the factory, in the food markets, at the shops, in the restaurants and hotels, alike in the city and in the village. They are familiar to you. They are the talk of every domestic circle and of every group of casual acquaintances even. It is matter of familiar knowledge, also, that a process has set in which is likely, unless something is done, to push prices and rents and the whole cost of living higher and yet higher, in a vicious cycle to which there is no logical or natural end. With the increase in the prices of the necessaries of life come demands for increases in wages,—demands which are justified if there be no other means of enabling men to live. Upon the increase of wages there follows close an increase in the price of the products whose producers have been accorded the increase,—not a proportionate increase, for the manufacturer does not content himself with that, but an increase considerably greater than the added wage cost and for which the added wage cost is oftentimes hardly more than an excuse. The <word altform="laborers">labourers</word> who do not get an increase in pay when they demand it are likely to strike, and the strike only makes matters worse. It checks production. If it affects the railways it prevents distribution and strips the markets, so that there is presently nothing to buy, and there is another excessive addition to prices resulting from the scarcity.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">These are facts and forces with which we have become only too familiar; but we are not justified because of our familiarity with them or because of any hasty and shallow conclusion that they are “natural” and inevitable in sitting inactively by and letting them work their fatal results if there is anything that we can do to check, correct, or reverse them. I have sought this opportunity to inform the Congress what the Executive is doing by way of remedy and control, and to suggest where effective legal remedies are lacking and may be supplied.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">We must, I think, frankly admit that there is no complete immediate remedy to be had from legislation and executive action. The free processes of supply and demand will not operate of themselves and no legislative or executive action can force them into full and natural operation until there is peace. There is now neither peace nor war. All the world is waiting,—with what unnerving fears and haunting doubts who can adequately say?—waiting to know when it shall have peace and what kind of peace it will be when it comes,—a peace in which each nation shall make shift for itself as it can, or a peace buttressed and supported by the will and concert of the nations that have the purpose and the power to do and to enforce what is right. Politically, economically, socially the World is on the operating table, and it has not been possible to administer any anesthetic. It is conscious. It even watches the capital operation upon which it knows that its hope of healthful life depends. It cannot think its business out or make plans or give intelligent and provident direction to its affairs while in such a case. Where there is no peace of mind there can be no energy in <word altform="endeavor">endeavour</word>. There can be no confidence in industry, no calculable basis for credits, no confident buying or systematic selling, no certain prospect of employment, no normal restoration of business, no hopeful attempt at reconstruction or the proper reassembling of the dislocated elements of enterprise until peace has been established and, so far as may be, guaranteed.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Our national life has no doubt been less radically disturbed and dismembered than the national life of other peoples whom the <abbr expan="World War I">war</abbr> more directly affected, with all its terrible ravaging and destructive force, but it has been, nevertheless, profoundly affected and disarranged, and our industries, our credits, our productive capacity, our economic processes are inextricably interwoven with those of other nations and peoples,—most intimately of all with the nations and peoples upon whom the chief burden and confusion of the war fell and who are now most dependent upon the cooperative action of the world.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">We are just now shipping more goods out of our ports to foreign markets than we ever shipped before,—not food stuffs merely, but stuffs and materials of every sort; but this is no index of what our foreign sales will continue to be or of the effect the volume of our exports will have on supplies and prices. It is impossible yet to predict how far or how long foreign purchasers will be able to find the money or the credit to pay for or sustain such purchases on such a scale; how soon or to what extent foreign manufacturers can resume their former production, foreign farmers get their accustomed crops from their own fields, foreign mines resume their former output, foreign merchants set up again their old machinery of trade with the ends of the earth. All these things must remain uncertain until peace is established and the nations of the world have concerted the methods by which normal life and industry are to be restored. All that we shall do, in the meantime, to restrain profiteering and put the life of our people upon a tolerable footing will be makeshift and provisional. There can be no settled conditions here or elsewhere until the treaty of peace is out of the way and the work of liquidating the war has become the chief concern of our government and of the other governments of the world. Until then business will inevitably remain speculative and sway now this way and again that, with heavy losses or heavy gains as it may chance, and the consumer must take care of both the gains and the losses. There can be no peace prices so long as our whole financial and economic system is on a war basis.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve"><place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Europe</place> will not, cannot recoup her capital or put her restless, distracted peoples to work until she knows exactly where she stands in respect of peace; and what we will do is for her the chief question upon which her quietude of mind and confidence of purpose depend. While there is any possibility that the peace terms may be changed or may be held long in abeyance or may not be enforced because of divisions of opinion among the Powers associated against <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Germany</place>, it is idle to look for permanent relief.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">But what we can do we should do, and should do at once. And there is a great deal that we can do, provisional though it be. Wheat shipments and credits to facilitate the purchase of our wheat can and will be limited and controlled in such a way as not to raise but rather to lower the price of flour here. The Government has the power, within certain limits, to regulate that. We cannot deny wheat to foreign peoples who are in dire need of it, and we do not wish to do so; but, fortunately, though the wheat crop is not what we hoped it would be, it is abundant if handled with provident care. The price of wheat is lower in the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> than in <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Europe</place>, and can with proper management be kept so.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">By way of immediate relief, surplus stocks of both food and clothing in the hands of the Government will be sold, and of course sold at prices at which there is no profit. And by way of a more permanent correction of prices surplus stocks in private hands will be drawn out of storage and put upon the market. Fortunately, under the terms of the Food Control Act the hoarding of food stuffs can be checked and prevented; and they will be, with the greatest energy. Food stuffs can be drawn out of storage and sold by legal action which the Department of Justice will institute wherever necessary; but so soon as the situation is systematically dealt with it is not likely that the courts will often have to be resorted to. Much of the accumulating of stocks has no doubt been due to the sort of speculation which always results from uncertainty. Great surpluses were accumulated because it was impossible to foresee what the market would disclose and dealers were determined to be ready for whatever might happen, as well as eager to reap the full advantage of rising prices. They will now see the disadvantage, as well as the danger, of holding off from the new process of distribution.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Some very interesting and significant facts with regard to stocks on hand and the rise of prices in the face of abundance have been disclosed by the inquiries of the Department of Agriculture, the Department of Labor and the Federal Trade Commission. They seem to justify the statement that in the case of many necessary commodities effective means have been found to prevent the normal operation of the law of supply and demand. Disregarding the surplus stocks in the hands of the Government, there was a greater supply of food stuffs in this country on <date value="1919-06-01">June first of this year</date> than at the same date last year. In the combined total of a number of the most important foods in dry and cold storage the excess is quite nineteen per cent. And yet prices have risen. The supply of fresh eggs on hand in June of this year, for example, was greater by nearly ten per cent. than the supply on hand at the same time last year and yet the wholesale price was forty cents a dozen as against thirty cents a year ago. The stock of frozen fowls had increased more than two hundred and ninety-eight per cent, and yet the price had risen also, from thirty-four and a half cents per pound to thirty-seven and a half cents. The supply of creamery butter had increased a hundred and twenty-nine per cent. and the price from forty-one to fifty-three cents per pound. The supply of salt beef had been augmented three per cent. and the price had gone up from thirty-four dollars a barrel to thirty-six dollars a barrel. Canned corn had increased in stock nearly ninety-two per cent. and had remained substantially the same in price. In a few food stuffs the prices had declined, but in nothing like the proportion in which the supply had increased. For example, the stock of canned tomatoes had increased one hundred and two per cent. and yet the price had declined only twenty-five cents per dozen cans. In some cases there had been the usual result of an increase of price following a decrease of supply, but in almost every instance the increase of price had been disproportionate to the decrease in stock.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The Attorney General has been making a careful study of the situation as a whole and of the laws that can be applied to better it and is convinced that, under the stimulation and temptation of exceptional circumstances, combinations of producers and combinations of traders have been formed for the control of supplies and of prices which are clearly in restraint of trade, and against these prosecutions will be promptly instituted and actively pushed which will in all likelihood have a prompt corrective effect. There is reason to believe that the prices of leather, of coal, of lumber, and of textiles have been materially affected by forms of concert and cooperation among the producers and marketers of these and other universally necessary commodities which it will be possible to redress. No watchful or energetic effort will be spared to accomplish this necessary result. I trust that there will not be many cases in which prosecution will be necessary. Public action will no doubt cause many who have perhaps unwittingly adopted illegal methods to abandon them promptly and of their own motion.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">And publicity can accomplish a great deal. The purchaser can often take care of himself if he knows the facts and influences he is dealing with; and purchasers are not disinclined to do anything, either singly or collectively, that may be necessary for their self-protection. The Department of Commerce, the Department of Agriculture, the Department of Labor, and the Federal Trade Commission can do a great deal towards supplying the public, systematically and at short intervals, with information regarding the actual supply of particular commodities that is in existence and available, with regard to supplies which are in existence but not available because of hoarding, and with regard to the methods of price fixing which are being used by dealers in certain food stuffs and other necessaries. There can be little doubt that retailers are in part,—sometimes in large part,—responsible for exorbitant prices; and it is quite practicable for the Government, through the agencies I have mentioned, to supply the public with full information as to the prices at which retailers buy and as to the costs of transportation they pay, in order that it may be known just what margin of profit they are demanding. Opinion and concerted action on the part of purchasers can probably do the rest.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">That is, these agencies may perform this indispensable service provided the Congress will supply them with the necessary funds to prosecute their inquiries and keep their price lists up to date. Hitherto the Appropriation Committees of the Houses have not always, I fear, seen the full value of these inquiries, and the Departments and Commissions have been very much straitened for means to render this service. That adequate funds be provided by appropriation for this purpose, and provided as promptly as possible, is one of the means of greatly ameliorating the present distressing conditions of livelihood that I have come to urge, in this attempt to concert with you the best ways to serve the country in this emergency. It is one of the absolutely necessary means, underlying many others, and can be supplied at once.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">There are many other ways. Existing law is inadequate. There are many perfectly legitimate methods by which the Government can exercise restraint and guidance.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Let me urge, in the first place, that the present food control Act should be extended both as to the period of time during which it shall remain in operation and as to the commodities to which it shall apply. Its provisions against hoarding should be made to apply not only to food but also to feed stuffs, to fuel, to clothing, and to many other commodities which are indisputably necessaries of life. As it stands now it is limited in operation to the period of the war and becomes inoperative upon the formal proclamation of peace. But I should judge that it was clearly within the constitutional power of the Congress to make similar permanent provisions and regulations with regard to all goods destined for inter-state commerce and to exclude them from inter-state shipment if the requirements of the law are not complied with. Some such regulation is imperatively necessary. The abuses that have grown up in the manipulation of prices by the withholding of food stuffs and other necessaries of life cannot otherwise be effectively prevented. There can be no doubt of either the necessity or the legitimacy of such measures. May I not call attention to the fact, also, that, although the present Act prohibits profiteering, the prohibition is accompanied by no penalty. It is clearly in the public interest that a penalty should be provided which will be persuasive.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">To the same end, I earnestly recommend, in the second place, that the Congress pass a law regulating cold storage as it is regulated, for example, by the laws of the State of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">New Jersey</place>, which limit the time during which goods may be kept in storage, prescribe the method of disposing of them if kept beyond the permitted period, and require that goods released from storage shall in all cases bear the date of their receipt. It would materially add to the serviceability of the law, for the purpose we now have in view, if it were also prescribed that all goods released from storage for inter-state shipment should have plainly marked upon each package the selling or market price at which they went into storage. By this means the purchaser would always be able to learn what profits stood between him and the producer or the wholesale dealer.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">It would serve as a useful example to the other communities of the country, as well as greatly relieve local distress, if the Congress were to regulate all such matters very fully for the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">District of Columbia</place>, where its legislative authority is without limit.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I would also recommend that it be required that all goods destined for inter-state commerce should in every case where their form or package makes it possible be plainly marked with the price at which they left the hands of the producer. Such a requirement would bear a close analogy to certain provisions of the Pure Food Act, by which it is required that certain detailed information be given on the labels of packages of foods and drugs.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">And it does not seem to me that we can confine ourselves to detailed measures of this kind, if it is indeed our purpose to assume national control of the processes of distribution. I take it for granted that that is our purpose and our duty. Nothing less will suffice. We need not hesitate to handle a national question in a national way. We should go beyond the measures I have suggested. We should formulate a law requiring a federal license of all corporations engaged in interstate commerce and embodying in the license, or in the conditions under which it is to be issued, specific regulations designed to secure competitive selling and prevent unconscionable profits in the method of marketing. Such a law would afford a welcome opportunity to effect other much needed reforms in the business of inter-state shipment and in the methods of corporations which are engaged in it; but for the moment I confine my recommendations to the object immediately in hand, which is to lower the cost of living.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">May I not add that there is a bill now pending before the Congress which, if passed, would do much to stop speculation and to prevent the fraudulent methods of promotion by which our people are annually fleeced of many millions of hard-earned money. I refer to the measure proposed by the Capital Issues Committee for the control of security issues. It is a measure formulated by men who know the actual conditions of business and its adoption would serve a great and beneficent purpose.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">We are dealing, Gentlemen of the Congress, I need hardly say, with very critical and very difficult matters. We should go forward with confidence along the road we see, but we should also seek to comprehend the whole of the scene amidst which we act. There is no ground for some of the fearful forecasts I hear uttered about me, but the condition of the world is unquestionably very grave and we should face it comprehendingly. The situation of our own country is exceptionally fortunate. We of all peoples can afford to keep our heads and to determine upon moderate and sensible courses of action which will ensure us against the passions and distempers which are working such deep unhappiness for some of the distressed nations on the other side of the sea. But we may be involved in their distresses unless we help, and help with energy and intelligence.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The world must pay for the appalling destruction wrought by the great war, and we are part of the world. We must pay our share. For five years now the industry of all <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Europe</place> has been slack and disordered. The normal crops have not been produced; the normal quantity of manufactured goods has not been turned out. Not until there are the usual crops and the usual production of manufactured goods on the other side of the Atlantic can <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Europe</place> return to the former conditions; and it was upon the former conditions, not the present, that our economic relations with <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Europe</place> were built up. We must face the fact that unless we help <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Europe</place> to get back to her normal life and production a chaos will ensue there which will inevitably be communicated to this country. For the present, it is manifest, we must quicken, not slacken our own production. We, and we almost alone, now hold the world steady. Upon our steadfastness and self-possession depend the affairs of nations everywhere. It is in this supreme crisis,—this crisis for all mankind,—that <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> must prove her mettle. In the presence of a world confused, distracted, she must show herself self-possessed, self-contained, capable of sober and effective action. She saved <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Europe</place> by her action in arms; she must now save it by her action in peace. In saving <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Europe</place> she will save herself, as she did upon the battlefields of the war. The calmness and capacity with which she deals with and masters the problems of peace will be the final test and proof of her place among the peoples of the world.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">And, if only in our own interest, we must help the people over seas. <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Europe</place> is our biggest customer. We must keep her going or thousands of our shops and scores of our mines must close. There is no such thing as letting her go to ruin without ourselves sharing in the disaster.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">In such circumstances, face to face with such tests, passion must be discarded. Passion and a disregard for the rights of others have no place in the counsels of a free people. We need light, not heat, in these solemn times of self-examination and saving action. There must be no threats. Let there be only intelligent counsel, and let the best reasons win, not the strongest brute force. The world has just destroyed the arbitrary force of a military junta. It will live under no other. All that is arbitrary and coercive is in the discard. Those who seek to employ it only prepare their own destruction.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">We cannot hastily and over night revolutionize all the processes of our economic life. We shall not attempt to do so. These are days of deep excitement and of extravagant speech; but with us these are things of the surface. Everyone who is in real touch with the silent masses of our great people knows that the old strong fibre and steady self-control are still there, firm against violence or any distempered action that would throw their affairs into confusion. I am serenely confident that they will readily find themselves, no matter what the circumstances, and that they will address themselves to the tasks of peace with the same devotion and the same stalwart preference for what is right that they displayed to the admiration of the whole world in the midst of war.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">And I entertain another confident hope. I have spoken to-day chiefly of measures of imperative regulation and legal compulsion, of prosecutions and the sharp correction of selfish processes; and these, no doubt, are necessary. But there are other forces that we may count on besides those resident in the Department of Justice. We have just fully awakened to what has been going on and to the influences, many of them very selfish and sinister, that have been producing high prices and imposing an intolerable burden on the mass of our people. To have brought it all into the open will accomplish the greater part of the result we seek. I appeal with entire confidence to our producers, our middlemen, and our merchants to deal fairly with the people. It is their opportunity to show that they comprehend, that they intend to act justly, and that they have the public interest sincerely at heart. And I have no doubt that housekeepers all over the country, and everyone who buys the things he daily stands in need of will presently exercise a greater vigilance, a more thoughtful economy, a more discriminating care as to the market in which he buys or the merchant with whom he trades than he has hitherto exercised.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I believe, too, that the more extreme leaders of organized labour will presently yield to a sober second thought and, like the great mass of their associates, think and act like true Americans. They will see that strikes undertaken at this critical time are certain to make matters worse, not better,—worse for them and for everybody else. The worst thing, the most fatal thing that can be done now is to stop or interrupt production or to interfere with the distribution of goods by the railways and the shipping of the country. We are all involved in the distressing results of the high cost of living and we must unite, not divide, to correct it. There are many things that ought to be corrected in the relations between capital and labour, in respect of wages and conditions of <word altform="labor">labour</word> and other things even more far-reaching, and I, for one, am ready to go into conference about these matters with any group of my fellow countrymen who know what they are talking about and are willing to remedy existing conditions by frank counsel rather than by violent contest. No remedy is possible while men are in a temper, and there can be no settlement which does not have as its motive and standard the general interest. Threats and undue insistence upon the interest of a single class make settlement impossible. I believe, as I have hitherto had occasion to say to the Congress, that the industry and life of our people and of the world will suffer irreparable damage if employers and workmen are to go on in a perpetual contest, as antagonists. They must, on one plan or another, be effectively associated. Have we not steadiness and self-possession and business sense enough to work out that result? Undoubtedly we have, and we shall work it out. In the meantime,—now and in the days of readjustment and recuperation that are ahead of us,—let us resort more and more to frank and intimate counsel and make ourselves a great and triumphant Nation by making ourselves a united force in the life of the world. It will not then have looked to us for leadership in vain.</p>

I am absolutely glad that the committee should have responded in this way to my intimation that I would like to be of service to it. I welcome the opportunity for a frank and full interchange of views.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I hope, too, that this conference will serve to expedite your consideration of the treaty of peace. I beg that you will pardon and indulge me if I again urge that practically the whole task of bringing the country back to normal conditions of life and industry waits upon the decision of the Senate with regard to the terms of the peace.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I venture thus again to urge my advice that the action of the Senate with regard to the treaty be taken at the earliest practicable moment because the problems with which we are face to face in the readjustment of our national life are of the most pressing and critical character, will require for their proper solution the most intimate and disinterested cooperation of all parties and all interests, and can not be postponed without manifest peril to our people and to all the national advantages we hold most dear. May I mention a few of the matters which can not be handled with intelligence until the country knows the character of the peace it is to have? I do so only by a very few samples.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The copper mines of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Montana</place>, <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Arizona</place>, and <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Alaska</place>, for example, are being kept open and in operation only at a great cost and loss, in part upon borrowed money; the zinc mines of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Missouri</place>, <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Tennessee</place>, and <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Wisconsin</place> are being operated at about one-half their capacity; the lead of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Idaho</place>, <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Illinois</place>, and <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Missouri</place> reaches only a portion of its former market: there is an immediate need for cotton belting, and also for lubricating oil, which can not be met—all because the channels of trade are barred by war when there is no war. The same is true of raw cotton, of which the Central Empires alone formerly purchased nearly 4,000,000 bales. And these are only examples. There is hardly a single raw material, a single important foodstuff, a single class of manufactured goods which is not in the same case. Our full, normal profitable production waits on peace.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Our military plans of course wait upon it. We can not intelligently or wisely decide how large a naval or military force we shall maintain or what our policy with regard to military training is to be until we have peace not only, but also until we know how peace is to be sustained, whether by the arms of single nations or by the concert of all the great peoples. And there is more than that difficulty involved. The vast surplus properties of the Army include not food and clothing merely, whose sale will affect normal production, but great manufacturing establishments also which should be restored to their former uses, great stores of machine tools, and all sorts of merchandise which must lie idle until peace and military policy are definitively determined. By the same token there can be no properly studied national budget until then.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The nations that ratify the treaty, such as <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Great Britain</place>, <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Belgium</place>, and <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">France</place>, will be in a position to lay their plans for controlling the markets of central <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Europe</place> without competition from us if we do not presently act. We have no consular agents, no trade representatives there to look after our interests.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">There are large areas of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Europe</place> whose future will lie uncertain and questionable until their people know the final settlements of peace and the forces which are to administer and sustain it. Without determinate markets our production can not proceed with intelligence or confidence. There can be no stabilization of wages because there can be no settled conditions of employment. There can be no easy or normal industrial credits because there can be no confident or permanent revival of business.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">But I will not weary you with obvious examples. I will only venture to repeat that every element of normal life amongst us depends upon and awaits the ratification of the treaty of peace; and also that we can not afford to lose a single summer’s day by not doing all that we can to mitigate the winter’s suffering, which, unless we find means to prevent it, may prove disastrous to a large portion of the world, and may, at its worst, bring upon <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Europe</place> conditions even more terrible than those wrought by the war itself.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Nothing, I am led to believe, stands in the way of the ratification of the treaty except certain doubts with regard to the meaning and implication of certain articles of the covenant of the league of nations; and I must frankly say that I am unable to understand why such doubts should be entertained. You will recall that when I had the pleasure of a conference with your committee and with the Committee of the House of Representatives on Foreign Affairs at the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">White House</place> in <date value="1919-03-99">March last</date> the questions now most frequently asked about the league of nations were all canvassed with a view to their immediate clarification. The covenant of the league was then in its first draft and subject to revision. It was pointed out that no express recognition was given to the Monroe doctrine; that it was not expressly provided that the league should have no authority to act or to express a judgment on matters of domestic policy; that the right to withdraw from the league was not expressly recognized; and that the constitutional right of the Congress to determine all questions of peace and war was not sufficiently safeguarded. On my return to <place reg="Paris, France" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Paris</place> all these matters were taken up again by the commission on the league of nations and every suggestion of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> was accepted.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The views of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> with regard to the questions I have mentioned had, in fact, already been accepted by the commission and there was supposed to be nothing inconsistent with them in the draft of the covenant first adopted—the draft which was the subject of our discussion in March—but no objection was made to saying explicitly in the text what all had supposed to be implicit in it. There was absolutely no doubt as to the meaning of any one of the resulting provisions of the covenant in the minds of those who participated in drafting them, and I respectfully submit that there is nothing vague or doubtful in their wording.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The Monroe doctrine is expressly mentioned as an understanding which is in no way to be impaired or interfered with by anything contained in the covenant and the expression “regional understandings like the Monroe doctrine” was used, not because anyone of the conferees thought there was any comparable agreement anywhere else in existence or in contemplation, but only because it was thought best to avoid the appearance of dealing in such a document with the policy of a single nation. Absolutely nothing is concealed in the phrase.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">With regard to domestic questions article 16 of the covenant expressly provides that, if in case of any dispute arising between members of the league the matter involved is claimed by one of the parties “and is found by the council to arise out of a matter which by international law is solely within the domestic jurisdiction of that party, the council shall so report, and shall make no recommendation as to its settlement.” The <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> was by no means the only Government interested in the explicit adoption of this provision, and there is no doubt in the mind of any authoritative student of international law that such matters as immigration, tariffs, and naturalization are incontestably domestic questions with which no international body could deal without express authority to do so. No enumeration of domestic questions was undertaken because to undertake it, even by sample, would have involved the danger of seeming to exclude those not mentioned.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The right of any sovereign State to withdraw had been taken for granted, but no objection was made to making it explicit. Indeed, so soon as the views expressed at the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">White House</place> conference were laid before the commission it was at once conceded that it was best not to leave the answer to so important a question to inference. No proposal was made to set up any tribunal to pass judgment upon the question whether a withdrawing nation had in fact fulfilled “all its international obligations and all its obligations under the covenant.” It was recognized that that question must be left to be resolved by the conscience of the nation proposing to withdraw; and I must say that it did not seem to me worth while to propose that the article be made more explicit, because I knew that the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> would never itself propose to withdraw from the league if its conscience was not entirely clear as to the fulfillment of all its international obligations. It has never failed to fulfill them and never will.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Article 10 is in no respect of doubtful meaning when read in the light of the covenant as a whole. The council of the league can only “advise upon” the means by which the obligations of that great article are to be given effect to. Unless the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> is a party to the policy or action in question, her own affirmative vote in the council is necessary before any advice can be given, for a unanimous vote of the council is required. If she is party, the trouble is hers anyhow. And the unanimous vote of the council is only advice in any case. Each Government is free to reject it if it pleases. Nothing could have been made more clear to the conference than the right of our Congress under our Constitution to exercise its independent judgment in all matters of peace and war. No attempt was made to question or limit that right. The <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> will, indeed, undertake under article 10 to “respect and preserve as against external aggression the territorial integrity and existing political independence of all members of the league,” and that engagement constitutes a very grave and solemn moral obligation. But it is a moral, not a legal, obligation, and leaves our Congress absolutely free to put its own interpretation upon it in all cases that call for action. It is binding in conscience only, not in law.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Article 10 seems to me to constitute the very backbone of the whole covenant. Without it the league would be hardly more than an influential debating society.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">It has several times been suggested, in public debate and in private conference, that interpretations of the sense in which the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> accepts the engagements of the covenant should be embodied in the instrument of ratification. There can be no reasonable objection to such interpretations accompanying the act of ratification provided they do not form a part of the formal ratification itself. Most of the interpretations which have been suggested to me embody what seems to me the plain meaning of the instrument itself. But if such interpretations should constitute a part of the formal resolution of ratification, long delays would be the inevitable consequence, inasmuch as all the many governments concerned would have to accept, in effect, the language of the Senate as the language of the treaty before ratification would be complete. The assent of the German Assembly at <place reg="Weimar, Germany" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Weimar</place> would have to be obtained, among the rest, and I must frankly say that I could only with the greatest reluctance approach that assembly for permission to read the treaty as we understand it and as those who framed it quite certainly understood it. If the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> were to qualify the document in any way, moreover, I am confident from what I know of the many conferences and debates which accompanied the formulation of the treaty that our example would immediately be followed in many quarters, in some instances with very serious reservations, and that the meaning and operative force of the treaty would presently be clouded from one end of its clauses to the other.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Pardon me, <personRef refurl="x4000447" reg="Henry Cabot Lodge" link-pointer-type="person">Mr. Chairman</personRef>, if I have been entirely unreserved and plain-spoken in speaking of the great matters we all have so much at heart. If excuse is needed, I trust that the critical situation of affairs may serve as my justification. The issues that manifestly hang upon the conclusions of the Senate with regard to peace and upon the time of its action are so grave and so clearly insusceptible of being thrust on one side or postponed that I have felt it necessary in the public interest to make this urgent plea, and to make it as simply and as unreservedly as possible.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I thought that the simplest way, <personRef refurl="x4000447" reg="Henry Cabot Lodge" link-pointer-type="person">Mr. Chairman</personRef>, to cover the points that I knew to be points of interest?</p>

         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Your reference to the necessity of action leads me to ask one question. If we have to restore peace to the world it is necessary, I assume, that there should be treaties with <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Austria</place>, <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Hungary</place>, <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Turkey</place>, and <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Bulgaria</place>. Those treaties are all more or less connected with the treaty with <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Germany</place>.

This treaty is the model for the others. I saw enough of the others before I left <place reg="Paris, France" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Paris</place> to know that they are being framed upon the same set of principles and that the treaty with <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Germany</place> is the model.

Would it be possible for us to see those other tentative plans?</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve"><personRef refurl="x4000418" reg="Woodrow Wilson" link-pointer-type="person">The <render as="smallcap" rend="inherit">President</render>.</personRef> I would have sent them to the committee with pleasure, <personRef refurl="x4000447" reg="Henry Cabot Lodge" link-pointer-type="person">Senator</personRef>, if I had found that I had them. I took it for granted that I had them, but the papers that remain in my hands remain there in a haphazard way. I can tell you the character of the other drafts. The British draft was the only one, as I remember, that was in the form of a definite constitution of a league. The French and Italian drafts were in the form of a series of propositions laying down general rules and assuming that the commission, or whatever body made the final formulation, would build upon those principles if they were adopted. They were principles quite consistent with the final action.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I remember saying to the committee when I was here in March—I have forgotten the expression I used—something to the effect that the British draft had constituted the basis. I thought afterwards that that was misleading, and I am very glad to tell the committee just what I meant.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Some months before the conference assembled, a plan for the league of nations had been drawn up by a British committee, at the head of which was <person link-pointer-type="person">Mr. Phillimore</person>—I believe the <person link-pointer-type="person">Mr. Phillimore</person> who was known as an authority on international law. A copy of that document was sent to me, and I built upon that a redraft. I will not now say whether I thought it was better or not an improvement; but I built on that a draft which was quite different, inasmuch as it put definiteness where there had been what seemed indefiniteness in the <person link-pointer-type="person">Phillimore</person> suggestion. Then, between that time and the time of the formation of the commission on the league of nations, I had the advantage of seeing a paper by <person refurl="x4000476" reg="Jan C. Smuts" link-pointer-type="person">Gen. Smuts</person>, of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">South Africa</place>, who seemed to me to have done some very clear thinking, particularly with regard to what was to be done with the pieces of the dismembered empires. After I got to <place reg="Paris, France" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Paris</place>, therefore, I rewrote the document to which I have alluded, and you may have noticed that it consists of a series of articles and then supplementary agreements. It was in the supplementary agreements that I embodied the additional ideas that had come to me not only from <person refurl="x4000476" reg="Jan C. Smuts" link-pointer-type="person">Gen. Smuts’s</person> paper but from other discussions. That is the full story of how the plan which I sent to the committee was built up.</p>

But let me say this, there is a little island which I must admit I had not heard of before.</p>

It is one of the bases and centers of cable and radio communication on the Pacific, and I made the point that the disposition, or rather the control, of that island should be reserved for the general conference which is to be held in regard to the ownership and operation of the cables. That subject is mentioned and disposed of in this treaty and that general cable conference is to be held.</p>

         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I wish to ask this further question: There was a secret treaty between <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">England</place> and <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Japan</place> in regard to <place reg="Shantung, China" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Shantung</place>; and in the correspondence with the British ambassador at <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Tokyo</place>, when announcing the acquiescence of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Great Britain</place> in <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Japan’s</place> having the German rights in <place reg="Shantung, China" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Shantung</place>, the British ambassador added:</p>

The legal obligation can be enforced by such machinery as there is to enforce it. We are therefore at liberty to interpret the sense in which we undertake a moral obligation.

My experience as a lawyer was not very long; but that experience would teach me that the language of a contract is always part of the debatable matter, and I can testify that in our discussions in the commission on the league of nations we did not discuss ideas half as much as we discussed phraseologies.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Senator <render as="smallcap" rend="inherit">McCumber</render>.

Oh, it might be, <personRef reg="James P. McCumber" link-pointer-type="person">Senator</personRef>, but we would not know for a good many months whether they were going to act in that sense or not.

         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve"><person reg="James P. McCumber" link-pointer-type="person">Senator <render as="smallcap" rend="inherit">McCumber</render></person>.

I had supposed it had been the general diplomatic practice with regard to reservations—which apply only to the reserving power, and not to all the signatories, of course—that with regard to reservations it had been the general practice that silence was regarded as acceptance and acquiescence; that there was that distinction between a textual amendment, which changed the treaty for every signatory, and a reservation, which changed it only for the reserving power.

Now, the public, the American people, a great proportion of them, have that same conviction, which is contrary to your view. Do you not think, therefore, that it would be well to have a reservation inserted in our resolution that shall so construe that section as to make it clear, not only to the American people but to the world, that Congress may use its own judgment as to what it will do, and that its failure to follow the judgment of the council will not be considered a breach of the agreement?</p>

If we embody in our resolution of ratification a statement that we understand section 10 or section 16 or section something else in a particular sense, and this Government, through its foreign department, transmits the proposed from of ratification to the chancellors of the other nations that are concerned in this treaty, and if those interpretations are the same as you have agreed upon with them in your conversations, I do not see how we would need anything more than a mere reply to that effect.</p>

It would not be submitted to her at all now, because she is not a member of the league? You catch the point?</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve"><personRef refurl="x4000418" reg="Woodrow Wilson" link-pointer-type="person">The <render as="smallcap" rend="inherit">President</render></personRef>. Yes. I differ with you there, <personRef refurl="x4000487" reg="Albert B. Fall" link-pointer-type="person">Senator</personRef>. One of the reasons for putting the league in the treaty was that <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Germany</place> was not going to be admitted to the league immediately, and we felt that it was very necessary that we should get her acknowledgment—acceptance—of the league as an international authority, partly because we were excluding her, so that she would thereafter have no ground for questioning such authority as the league might exercise under its covenant.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve"><person refurl="x4000487" reg="Albert B. Fall" link-pointer-type="person">Senator <render as="smallcap" rend="inherit">Fall</render></person>. Precisely.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve"><personRef refurl="x4000418" reg="Woodrow Wilson" link-pointer-type="person">The <render as="smallcap" rend="inherit">President</render></personRef>. Therefore, I think it would be necessary for her to acquiesce in a league the powers of which were differently construed.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve"><person refurl="x4000487" reg="Albert B. Fall" link-pointer-type="person">Senator <render as="smallcap" rend="inherit">Fall</render></person>. Precisely; but her acquiescence would be by her accepting the invitation, when extended, either to join the league or not to join the league. In other words, upon ratification by three of the powers, a status of peace is established, and as to those three powers and <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Germany</place> all the rules and regulations contained in the treaty of peace become operative. As to the other nations which have not ratified, the status of peace exists; that is, war has terminated. Now, that being the case, and <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Germany</place> being out of the league—not having been invited to join the league—if in ratifying the treaty we ratify it with certain explanations or reservations, even in the ratifying resolution, when the time comes and <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Germany</place> is invited to become a member of the league, or when she applies, under the admission clause of the league, for membership therein, if she enters she of course accepts our reservations. If she makes a qualified application, then it is for the league itself to consider whether she will be admitted?</p>

I do not follow your reasoning in the matter, <personRef refurl="x4000487" reg="Albert B. Fall" link-pointer-type="person">Senator</personRef>, because this is not merely a question of either membership or nonmembership. The covenant is a part of the treaty, it is a part of the treaty which she has signed, and we are not at liberty to change any part of that treaty without the acquiescence of the other contracting party.</p>

Well, <personRef refurl="x4000418" reg="Woodrow Wilson" link-pointer-type="person">Mr. President</personRef>, of course it is not my purpose to enter into an argument, but we are here for information. There are provisions for the amendment of the articles. <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Germany</place> is out of the league. Any amendment proposed by the other members of the league prior to her coming into the league would not be submitted to her, would it, she not being a member?</p>

If you believe there is nothing more to this than a moral obligation, any nation will assume a moral obligation on its own account. Is it a moral obligation? The point I am trying to get at is, Suppose something arises affecting the peace of the world, and the council takes steps as provided here to conserve or preserve, and announces its decision, and every nation in the league takes advantage of the construction that you place upon these articles and says, “Well, this is only a moral obligation, and we assume that the nation involved does not deserve our participation or protection,” and the whole thing amounts to nothing but an expression of the league council.</p>

There is a national good conscience in such a matter. I should think that was one of the most serious things that could possibly happen. When I speak of a legal obligation, I mean one that specifically binds you to do a particular thing under certain sanctions. That is a legal obligation. Now a moral obligation is of course superior to a legal obligation, and, if I may say so, has a greater binding force; only there always remains in the moral obligation the right to exercise one’s judgment as to whether it is indeed incumbent upon one in those circumstances to do that thing. In every moral obligation there is an element of judgment. In a legal obligation there is no element of judgment.</p>

No, sir; I do not.

I think it is proper for me to answer that question, sir. I will put it in this way: They felt that they could not recede from them, that is to say, that they were bound by them, but when they involved general interests such as they realized were involved, they were quite willing, and indeed I think desirous, that they should be reconsidered with the consent of the other parties. I mean with the consent, so far as they were concerned, of the other parties.</p>

So that if the treaty should fail of ratification, <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">China</place>, so far as <place reg="Shantung, China" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Shantung</place> is concerned, would be practically at the mercy of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Japan</place>; whereas if the treaty is ratified, then at least she will have the benefit of the moral assistance of all the other signatory powers to the treaty to aid in the protection of Chinese rights?</p>

After all, the wars that are likely to come are most likely to come by aggression against the weaker nations. Without the league of nations they have no buttress or protection. With it, they have the united protection of the world; and inasmuch as it is the universal opinion that the great tragedy through which we have just passed never would have occurred if the Central Powers had dreamed that a number of nations would be combined against them, so I have the utmost confidence that this notice beforehand that the strong nations of the world will in every case be united will make war extremely unlikely.</p>

I have here <personRef refurl="x4000418" reg="Woodrow Wilson" link-pointer-type="person">the President’s</personRef> statement which he read to us when we met here this morning, and in it he states:</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Nothing, I am led to believe, stands in the way of the ratification of the treaty except certain doubts with regard to the meaning and implication of certain articles of the covenant of the league of nations; and I must frankly say that I am unable to understand why such doubts should be entertained.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Now, I do not believe <personRef refurl="x4000418" reg="Woodrow Wilson" link-pointer-type="person">the President</personRef> is correctly informed as to the situation if he believes that. There are things in the treaty itself which militate against the ratification, in my opinion, of the treaty without amendment. Did you have in mind, <personRef refurl="x4000418" reg="Woodrow Wilson" link-pointer-type="person">Mr. President</personRef>, when you read that to us, the <place reg="Shantung, China" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Shantung</place> provision of the treaty?</p>

I certainly had that in mind, <personRef reg="Frank B. Brandegee" link-pointer-type="person">Senator</personRef>, but I did not understand that that stood in the way of ratification. I am, of course, acting only upon such information as I have received.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve"><person refurl="x4003777" reg="Frank B. Brandegee" link-pointer-type="person">Senator <render as="smallcap" rend="inherit">Brandegee</render></person>. I understand—and that is the reason of taking the liberty of suggesting to you that you may not be well informed in this respect. Of course there is opposition by a great many Senators to the entire covenant of the league of nations, which</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I have no doubt you know, that is, article 1 of the treaty of Versailles. Then there is opposition to the various parts of the covenants of the league and not to the whole league, by other Senators. Then there is a great opposition, fundamental and sincere, to the <place reg="Shantung, China" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Shantung</place> provision, which is in the body of the treaty itself, and which can only be cured by an amendment. As I understand it, no reservation that we could make in the resolution of ratification would be effective to strike out the <place reg="Shantung, China" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Shantung</place> provision. It must be cured, if it is cured, by a straight out-and-out amendment, striking that from the treaty. That, of course, would necessitate the resubmission of the treaty to the signatories who have already signed it.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Now, you state later on that every suggestion of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> was accepted, that is after you went back, after you had your conference with us last March, and having obtained our views as to the necessity for certain changes in the first draft of the covenant, you state [reading]:</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The view of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> with regard to the questions I have mentioned had, in fact, already been accepted by the commission and there was supposed to be nothing inconsistent with them in the draft of the covenant first adopted.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">And omitting a few lines which do not apply to that you say [reading]:</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">There was absolutely no doubt as to the meaning of any one of the resulting provisions of the covenant in the minds of those who participated in drafting them, and I respectfully submit that there is nothing vague or doubtful in their wording.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Of course that is your opinion, if I may say so.</p>

That is, you admit that there are grave doubts among the ablest lawyers of the country as to the necessity for reservations or the alternative between reservations and ratifying the whole treaty, as it is expressed in the vernacular, without the dotting of an “i” or the crossing of a “t.”</p>

Now, of course, it is true, is it not, that if difficulties arise as to the construction of any provision of the treaty after we have passed from the scene, what we thought the provisions of the treaty or of the covenant meant, will not be very powerful in the construction that may be placed upon it by those who then have to determine what it means, will it?</p>

I do not mean that. The fact that you think now that everything in the treaty is plain and that there is no doubt about the meaning of any provisions, and the fact that I think there is grave doubt about many of the provisions, will not seriously affect the opinion of the council or of the arbitrator that finally passes upon the true meaning of the treaty when dispute arises.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve"><personRef refurl="x4000418" reg="Woodrow Wilson" link-pointer-type="person">The <render as="smallcap" rend="inherit">President</render></personRef>. No, <personRef reg="Frank B. Brandegee" link-pointer-type="person">Senator</personRef>; but the plain wording of the treaty will have a great deal to do, and the meaning of the wording is plain.</p>

That is simply another way of stating, is it not, that you are clear in your opinion that the provisions of the treaty are plain?

Of course they will have the language before them, but the language which determines it is now in dispute between you and certain lawyers of the country and certain Senators as to its meaning.

         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The members of the league agree that if there should arise between them any dispute likely to lead to a rupture, they will submit the matter either to arbitration or to inquiry by the council, and they agree in no case to resort to war until three months after the award by the arbitrators or the report by the council.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">That is, if there is a dispute, as I construe this, between members of the league as to the meaning of the covenant or any article thereof, it shall be referred to the arbitrators.</p>

No, <personRef reg="Frank B. Brandegee" link-pointer-type="person">Senator</personRef>; I beg your pardon. There are two processes. If the parties agree to submit to arbitration, of course it is submitted to arbitration, and the decision is final. If they think it is a question that they are not willing to submit to arbitration, then they must submit it to the council for an expression of opinion and a recommendation, but that opinion and recommendation do not bind.</p>

That is true of every treaty, <personRef reg="Frank B. Brandegee" link-pointer-type="person">Senator</personRef>. If you re-express it in the language of the Senators to whom you refer and there is a dispute about the meaning of that, the same would apply. You can not use any language, I assume, which could not possibly give rise to some sort of dispute.</p>

I assume that if it provided that if there should arise between the members of the league any dispute in relation to the construction of any article of the covenant of the league of nations, such dispute should be referred to an arbitrator, and the members would agree to be bound by its decision; that would be an agreement for an authoritative determination of what the treaty meant.</p>

Under article 10 the members of the league undertake to respect and preserve as against external aggression the territorial integrity and existing political independence of all members of the league.

Of course, it is a moral duty to keep a promise, and this is an international promise; so that the distinction between a moral obligation and a legal one seems to me to be not of great importance, because we are obligated in any event.</p>

No. For example, a question is submitted to arbitration and it is agreed that the decision shall be final. The judgment of one of the parties to the controversy may be that the decision is a very bad one, but it has to accept it; the element of judgment is excluded altogether; but, with regard to the method of fulfilling the obligations of a covenant like that under consideration there is freedom of judgment on the part of the individual members of the league. It seems to me that makes a very considerable difference.</p>

Then, let us go back to the original inquiry. What permanent value is there, then, to this compact?</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve"><personRef refurl="x4000418" reg="Woodrow Wilson" link-pointer-type="person">The <render as="smallcap" rend="inherit">President</render></personRef>. The greatest permanent value, <personRef refurl="x4002336" reg="Warren G. Harding" link-pointer-type="person">Senator</personRef>, is the point that I have raised. We are assuming that the United States will not concur in the general moral judgment of the world. In my opinion, she generally will. If it had been known that this war was coming on, her moral judgment would have concurred with that of the other Governments of the world, with that of the other peoples of the world; and if <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Germany</place> had known that there was a possibility of that sort of concurrence, she never would have dared to do what she did. Without such notice served on the powers that may wish to repeat the folly that <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Germany</place> commenced, there is no assurance to the world that there will be peace even for a generation, whereas if they know beforehand that there will be that concert of judgment, there is the most tremendous guaranty.</p>

But, <personRef refurl="x4000418" reg="Woodrow Wilson" link-pointer-type="person">Mr. President</personRef>, nobody expressed for us our moral obligation to enter into this war. That was our own expression, was it not?</p>

One of the points I am getting at, if I can make it clear, is the necessity of a written compact for this Republic to fulfill its moral obligations to civilization.</p>

Now, if I may proceed without interruption, which breaks the continuity of my thought and uses a great deal of time, I will be through in a very few minutes. As I understand <personRef refurl="x4000418" reg="Woodrow Wilson" link-pointer-type="person">the President</personRef>, his construction of article 10 is that if the council considers the question of external aggression upon a member of the league, we, having signed this treaty with article 10 in it, in which we undertake to preserve against external aggression the territorial integrity of all members of the league, can then say, it is a moral question into which the element of judgment enters and we, considering our judgment binding at the time, do not care to agree to the recommendation of the council. If every member of the league is at liberty to take that view of its moral and legal obligations under article 10, and declines to do what the council recommends, and if it is known in advance that that is the construction placed upon article 10 by those who framed it, it does not seem to me—and this is merely my opinion—that the terror to wrongdoers by what is hoped to be the united, concerted action of the members of the league in the concentration of its powers to suppress the wrongdoer will have the effect that <personRef refurl="x4000418" reg="Woodrow Wilson" link-pointer-type="person">the President</personRef> thinks it will. In other words, I do not think that <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Germany</place> would have refrained from war if she had known that article 10 was in existence.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Article 10 says:</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">In case of any such aggression, or in case of any threat or danger of such aggression, the council shall advise upon the means by which this obligation shall be fulfilled.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">There is no doubt that that is an obligation in a contract, and I know of but one way to perform an obligation that you have contracted to perform, and that is to perform it. I do not think that it admits of any qualifications after you sign the treaty. I want to call attention also to the fact that the external aggression which we undertake, if we sign this treaty, to repel or guarantee against is not stated in the treaty at all to be an unwarranted aggression. I wish to ask <personRef refurl="x4000418" reg="Woodrow Wilson" link-pointer-type="person">the President</personRef>, if the league were in existence and <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Hungary</place> and <place reg="Romania" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Roumania</place> were members of it, and <place reg="Romania" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Roumania</place> were in the position she now is, having raided the territorial integrity of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Hungary</place> and marched through its capital and occupied it, and the council, as its duty would be under the covenant, considered what was best to be done and advised us to send immediately to cooperate with them 100,000 men, whether we would be at liberty to discuss whether we were morally bound by article 10 of the covenant and decline to send the men, and, if we were, could we do it without risking being called an “international slacker” by the other members of the league?</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve"><personRef refurl="x4000418" reg="Woodrow Wilson" link-pointer-type="person">The <render as="smallcap" rend="inherit">President</render></personRef>. <personRef reg="Frank B. Brandegee" link-pointer-type="person">Senator</personRef>, since you have made the case a concrete one I am afraid I ought not to answer it, because it involves a judgment as between <place reg="Romania" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Roumania</place> and <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Hungary</place>.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve"><person refurl="x4003777" reg="Frank B. Brandegee" link-pointer-type="person">Senator <render as="smallcap" rend="inherit">Brandegee</render></person>. I withdraw the names of the two countries, and assume the circumstances.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve"><personRef refurl="x4000418" reg="Woodrow Wilson" link-pointer-type="person">The <render as="smallcap" rend="inherit">President</render></personRef>. Let me say that I take it for granted that in practically every case the United States would respond; but that does not seem to be the question. I quite agree with you that a moral obligation is to be fulfilled, and I am confident that our Nation will fulfill it, but that does not remove from each individual case the element of judgment which we are free to exercise in two stages: We are, first, free to exercise it in the vote of our representative on the council, who will of course act under instructions from the home Government; and, in the second place, we are to exercise it when the President, acting upon the action of the council, makes his recommendation to Congress. Then, Congress is to exercise its judgment as to whether or not the instructions of the Executive to our member of the council were well founded, and whether the case is one of distinct moral obligation.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve"><person refurl="x4003777" reg="Frank B. Brandegee" link-pointer-type="person">Senator <render as="smallcap" rend="inherit">Brandegee</render></person>. Suppose that each member of the council, as you say, acting under instructions from its home Government, including our representative on the council, should think, for instance, that <place reg="Romania" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Roumania</place> was entirely right in some invasion of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Hungary</place>, and public sentiment was that way, but that our Government instructed our representative to vote with the foreign members of the council to support <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Hungary</place>—suppose the public sentiment of the other members and of the people of this country were in favor of <place reg="Romania" rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Roumania</place>, what sort of a position would we be in to fulfill our guaranty?</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve"><personRef refurl="x4000418" reg="Woodrow Wilson" link-pointer-type="person">The <render as="smallcap" rend="inherit">President</render></personRef>. In order to answer that question I must go a little bit afield. In the first place, I understand that article to mean that no nation is at liberty to invade the territorial integrity of another. That does not mean to invade for purposes of warfare, but to impair the territorial integrity of another nation. Its territorial integrity is not destroyed by armed intervention; it is destroyed by the retention of territory, by taking territory away from it; that impairs its territorial integrity. I understand the covenant to mean that that is in no case permissible by the action of a single nation against another; that there is only one permissible method and that is, if territorial arrangements are unsatisfactory, that they should be brought to the attention of the world through the league and that then the league should exercise such rights as it may be able to exercise for a readjustment of boundaries.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I believe that territorial aggression, in the sense of territorial capture, is, by the wording of the act, made illegitimate.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve"><person refurl="x4003777" reg="Frank B. Brandegee" link-pointer-type="person">Senator <render as="smallcap" rend="inherit">Brandegee</render></person>. The words are not “territorial aggression,” but “external aggression.”</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve"><personRef refurl="x4000418" reg="Woodrow Wilson" link-pointer-type="person">The <render as="smallcap" rend="inherit">President</render></personRef>. But it says the preservation of its territorial integrity against external aggression.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve"><person refurl="x4003777" reg="Frank B. Brandegee" link-pointer-type="person">Senator <render as="smallcap" rend="inherit">Brandegee</render></person>. Suppose the external aggressor, having gotten within the territory of the aggressee, stays there?</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve"><personRef refurl="x4000418" reg="Woodrow Wilson" link-pointer-type="person">The <render as="smallcap" rend="inherit">President</render></personRef>. Then that impairs the territorial integrity.</p>

Certainly; and then on a call by the council for us to perform our international contract under article 10, if Congress does not favor performing it, you think we would not be subject to criticism by the other members of the league?</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve"><personRef refurl="x4000418" reg="Woodrow Wilson" link-pointer-type="person">The <render as="smallcap" rend="inherit">President</render></personRef>.

         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve"><personRef refurl="x4000418" reg="Woodrow Wilson" link-pointer-type="person">The <render as="smallcap" rend="inherit">President</render></personRef>. Yes; that is understood by all.</p>

Of course; but I am assuming if the council should advise us to do a certain thing, and Congress refused to do it—and if every nation’s representative assembly can do the same thing, it seems to me like a rope of sand and not an effective tribunal which would result in promoting peace.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve"><personRef refurl="x4000418" reg="Woodrow Wilson" link-pointer-type="person">The <render as="smallcap" rend="inherit">President</render></personRef>. The reason I do not agree with you, Senator, is that I do not think such a refusal would likely often occur. I believe it would be only upon the gravest grounds—and in case Congress is right, I am indifferent to foreign criticism.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve"><person refurl="x4003777" reg="Frank B. Brandegee" link-pointer-type="person">Senator <render as="smallcap" rend="inherit">Brandegee</render></person>. Of course, we would always think we were right, I assume. Now, I wish to call your attention to article 15. I do this simply because you think all these provisions are clear, and I want to say in that connection that we had Mr. Miller, who described himself as the technical expert or adviser to the American Peace Commission, especially, I think, on questions of international law.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve"><personRef refurl="x4000418" reg="Woodrow Wilson" link-pointer-type="person">The <render as="smallcap" rend="inherit">President</render></personRef>. The league of nations.</p>

We had him before our committee, and he answered this question, that I am about to ask, in three different ways, and we could not, of course, get much information from him; and he promised to take it under advisement and to give us his considered opinion, but he has not done so. Now, article 15, in the last two paragraphs provides:</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The council may in any case under this article refer the dispute to the assembly. The dispute shall be so referred at the request of either party to the dispute, provided that such request be made within 14 days after the submission of the dispute to the council.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">In any case referred to the assembly, all the provisions of this article and of article 12 relating to the action and powers of the council shall apply to the action and powers of the assembly, provided that a report made by the assembly, if concurred in by the representatives of those members of the league represented on the council and of a majority of the other members of the league, exclusive in each case of the representatives of the parties to the dispute, shall have the same force as a report by the council concurred in by all the members thereof other than the representatives of one or more of the parties to the dispute.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Now, in the first place, it says “represented on the council and of a majority of the other members of the league.” Does that mean that the various members of the league have got to act upon that as separate Governments, or does it mean the representatives of the other members of the league?</p>

         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Does that mean there “and a majority of the other representatives of members of the league in the assembly”?</p>

Very well. Now, the question: Supposing there were a dispute between the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> and that portion of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">British Empire</place> known as the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United Kingdom</place>—<place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">England</place>, <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Ireland</place>, <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Scotland</place>, and <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Wales</place>—as to some right of one of our ships to enter an English port, for instance, and that dispute should come before the council, and, upon the request of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Great Britain</place>, it should be removed to the assembly. The article I have just read provides for a report concurred in “exclusive in each case of the representatives of the parties to the dispute.”</p>

Now, all the self-governing colonies of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">England</place>, or at least five of them, have a vote in the assembly, and the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">British Empire</place> also has a vote. I assume in the case of the dispute which I have supposed, of course, the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> would be excluded from voting, as being a party to the dispute; and I assume the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">British Empire</place> would be excluded, but I am not sure.</p>

They are parts of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">British Empire</place>, but are they parties to the dispute which I have supposed to have arisen between us and <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">England</place>?</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve"><personRef refurl="x4000418" reg="Woodrow Wilson" link-pointer-type="person">The <render as="smallcap" rend="inherit">President</render></personRef>. I admit, <personRef reg="Frank B. Brandegee" link-pointer-type="person">Senator</personRef>, that that is a complicated question; but my judgment about it is quite clear. I think I can give one instead of three answers.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve"><person refurl="x4003777" reg="Frank B. Brandegee" link-pointer-type="person">Senator <render as="smallcap" rend="inherit">Brandegee</render></person>. Yes.</p>

Disputes can arise only through the Governments which have international representation. In other words, diplomatically speaking, there is only one “<place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">British Empire</place>.” The parts of it are but pieces of the whole. The dispute, therefore, in the case you have supposed, would be between the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> as a diplomatic unit and the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">British Empire</place> as a diplomatic unit. That is the only ground upon which the two nations could deal with one another, whether by way of dispute or agreement. Therefore, I have assumed, and confidently assumed, that the representatives of all parts of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">British Empire</place> would be excluded.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve"><person refurl="x4003777" reg="Frank B. Brandegee" link-pointer-type="person">Senator <render as="smallcap" rend="inherit">Brandegee</render></person>. I should think that would be only fair, and I would assume that; but <person link-pointer-type="person">Mr. Miller</person> answered that question by saying, first, that he was in doubt; secondly, that the self-governing colonies of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Great Britain</place> or of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">British Empire</place> would not be excluded, because they were not parties to the dispute; and then, third, that they would be excluded because they were parts of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">British Empire</place>; and if the legal adviser of the commission was that much confused, I feel that I need not apologize for being confused myself.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve"><personRef refurl="x4000418" reg="Woodrow Wilson" link-pointer-type="person">The <render as="smallcap" rend="inherit">President</render></personRef>. No; but the commission was not confused.</p>

May I say this: I was not present at the meeting when <person link-pointer-type="person">Mr. Miller</person> testified. The fact is that while it is technically true, as <personRef refurl="x4000418" reg="Woodrow Wilson" link-pointer-type="person">the President</personRef>, says that the British self-governing colonies deal diplomatically through the British foreign office, it is only true in a most technical sense. They are absolutely autonomous, even in their diplomatic dealings, as to matters that affect them. For instance, I remember when the Canadian reciprocity agreement was negotiated in <date value="1911-99-99">1911</date> the delegates sent to negotiate the agreement were from <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Canada</place>. <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Great Britain</place> did not appear at the hearings or conferences at all, and in every sense <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Canada</place> was just as autonomous in conducting her international negotiations as she would have been if she had been an absolutely independent Government.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve"><personRef refurl="x4000418" reg="Woodrow Wilson" link-pointer-type="person">The <render as="smallcap" rend="inherit">President</render></personRef>. Yes; but this, you see, <personRef reg="Philander C.

         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve"><person refurl="x4003596" reg="Philander C. Knox" link-pointer-type="person">Senator <render as="smallcap" rend="inherit">Knox</render></person>. But the fact that you give representation to <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Canada</place> and <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Australia</place> and <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">New Zealand</place> and other autonomous self-governing British colonies rather contradicts the idea, does it not, that they are one Government?</p>

I think not, sir; because in making up the constitution of the council it was provided, to speak with technical accuracy, that the five principal allied or associated Governments should each have one representative in the league; and in the opening paragraph of the treaty itself those powers are enumerated, and among others is the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">British Empire</place>. “The Empire of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Great Britain</place>,” I think, is the technical term. Therefore their unity is established by their representation in the council.</p>

But, if you will allow me to say so, it does not say that these parties, the self-governing British colonies, shall be excluded from participating in the deliberations because they may have some interest in the controversy.</p>

No; I beg your pardon, <personRef refurl="x4000418" reg="Woodrow Wilson" link-pointer-type="person">Mr. President</personRef>. In a subsequent clause dealing with what I think is an entirely different matter—that is, the adjustments as between the nations, not adjustments as between the allied and associated powers and <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Germany</place>—it comes into force whenever the ratifications are made; but if you will take the body of the treaty you will find that everything that <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Germany</place> is to do is to be done within a certain number of days after the ratification has been made; and a certain number of months afterwards she is to demobilize, give up her ships, and do all things that will make her practically a noncombatant, within a number of days after ratification by three of the powers; so she is either at peace with the world, or she is only partially at peace with the world; and as the requirements of the treaty are specific that she is to go out of the war business altogether, there is a conclusive inference in my mind that she is at peace with the world when those three ratifications have been made.</p>

I can not agree with you there. You see, the theory is this: That when three of the principal allied and associated powers ratify this treaty, <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Germany</place> having ratified it, then the treaty is in force; that is to say, she has then engaged to do the things provided in the treaty, and her engagement is with those three powers, among the rest, and she must then proceed to do what she has promised; but it does not establish peace between her and other countries.</p>

Suppose you would determine that when any group of nations adopted a treaty then we could adopt the treaty that contained certain provisions that we wished to put in, and to make the operation of the treaty contingent upon its acceptance by the other nations in the group. It seems to me that that is an entirely analogous case. In other words I am assuming that we adopt the treaty with <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Germany</place>. In that case we will be members of the league. We are in effect saying that we have become members of the league. If the council of the league accepts this we agree to put it in force. It is a means of being consistent with the thing that we have already done in becoming a member of the league.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve"><person refurl="x4003777" reg="Frank B. Brandegee" link-pointer-type="person">Senator <render as="smallcap" rend="inherit">Brandegee</render></person>. I get your viewpoint about that. Now, do you think it is wise for us to adopt the Franco-American treaty which in substance provides that we can not denounce it until the council of the league of nations gives us permission to do so or agrees to denounce it.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The <render as="smallcap" rend="inherit">President</render>. I do, <personRef reg="Frank B. Brandegee" link-pointer-type="person">Senator</personRef>. I have a very strong feeling with regard to our historical relations with <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">France</place>, and also a very keen appreciation of her own sense of danger, and I think it would be one of the handsomest acts of history to enter into that.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve"><person refurl="x4003777" reg="Frank B. Brandegee" link-pointer-type="person">Senator <render as="smallcap" rend="inherit">Brandegee</render></person>. I feel just as cordially toward her heroic conduct as anybody can. But that was not the question. The question was whether it was wise to so tie ourselves to any foreign nation as that we never could repudiate—I will not use the word “repudiate”—can never cancel our treaties without due notice, without the consent of a body not yet created.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve"><personRef refurl="x4000418" reg="Woodrow Wilson" link-pointer-type="person">The <render as="smallcap" rend="inherit">President</render></personRef>. Of course I am assuming that body will be created before we adopt the Franco-American treaty, and in that case that provision that you are alluding to is only a completion of the idea of the treaty, namely, as I have been quoted as saying, this is an agreement on our part to anticipate the advice of the council of the league, as we shall take such and such measures to defend France. Inasmuch as we are anticipating that, we are assuming the action of the league, and therefore it is with the league and its action that the whole matter is bound up, and I think that the provision you allude to, therefore, is consistent and almost logically necessary.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve"><person refurl="x4003777" reg="Frank B. Brandegee" link-pointer-type="person">Senator <render as="smallcap" rend="inherit">Brandegee</render></person>. Well, now, inasmuch as you have stated in your message—and I have of course agreed to it and have no doubt that it is true—that the Franco-American treaty is only designed for temporary purposes, the defense of France until the league says that it is competent to do it, or words to that effect—</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve"><personRef refurl="x4000418" reg="Woodrow Wilson" link-pointer-type="person">The <render as="smallcap" rend="inherit">President</render></personRef>. Yes.</p>

Would it not be the part of prudence for us to include in the Franco-American treaty, if it should be ratified, a provision that it shall have some time limit put upon it, that it shall exist for not more than 10 years, say. I assume if the league is ever going to be effective to preserve the territorial integrity and political independence of its various members, it will be in the course of 10 years, and there is no objection to having some time limit on the treaty.</p>

I want to call your attention to the fact that this era of good feeling which exists between the allied and associated powers after their common experience and suffering in this great war may not always exist, in view of future commercial contests and separate interests of different nationalities which may occur in the future, and what some of us feel is that we ought to be careful in making these definite international engagements, which we are wisely determined to carry out in good faith if we should make them, and we feel that now is the time to understand exactly the obligations we are to be held to before we affix our signature, and I have no doubt that you agree to that.</p>

Why, <personRef reg="Frank B. Brandegee" link-pointer-type="person">Senator</personRef>, it was done as all other things of this sort were done over there. We circulated the draft among the representatives of the 14 States who were represented in the general league of nations, and they had 10 days or more to examine it. I also submitted it to my colleagues, not for any formal discussion but in order to have their opinion if they chose to express it. Then when the commission got down to its real work they appointed a committee.</p>

Let me say this in regard to article 10. I believe this to be a part of the history of it. It is so far as I am concerned. Early in my administration, as I think many of the members know, I tried to get the American States, the States of Central and <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">South America</place>, to join with us in an arrangement in which a phrase like this constituted the kernel, that we guaranteed to each other territorial integrity and political independence. “Under a republican form of government” was added in that case. But that is another matter. As I represented to them at that time, it was a desire on my part at any rate to show the way to them of keeping things steady and preventing the kind of aggression they have had.</p>

The whole system of mandates is intended for the development and protection of the territories to which they apply—that is to say, to protect their inhabitants, to assist their development under the operation of the opinion of the world, and to lead to their ultimate independent existence.</p>

         <p rend="noindent" xml:space="preserve"><render as="smallcap" rend="inherit">To the Senate and House of Representatives</render>:</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I sincerely regret that I cannot be present at the opening of this session of the Congress. I am thus prevented from presenting in as direct a way as I could wish the many questions that are pressing for solution at this time. Happily, I have had the advantage of the advice of the heads of the several executive departments who have kept in close touch with affairs in their detail and whose thoughtful recommendations I earnestly second.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">In the matter of the railroads and the readjustment of their affairs growing out of federal control, I shall take the liberty at a later date of addressing you.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I hope that Congress will bring to a conclusion at this session legislation looking to the establishment of a budget system. That there should be one single authority responsible for the making of all appropriations and that appropriations should be made not independently of each other, but with reference to one single comprehensive plan of expenditure properly related to the nation’s income, there can be no doubt. I believe the burden of preparing the budget must, in the nature of the case, if the work is to be properly done and responsibility concentrated instead of divided, rest upon the executive. The budget so prepared should be submitted to and approved or amended by a single committee of each House of Congress and no single appropriation should be made by the Congress, except such as may have been included in the budget prepared by the executive or added by the particular committee of Congress charged with the budget legislation.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Another and not less important aspect of the problem is the ascertainment of the economy and efficiency with which the moneys appropriated are expended. Under existing law the only audit is for the purpose of ascertaining whether expenditures have been lawfully made within the appropriations. No one is authorized or equipped to ascertain whether the money has been spent wisely, economically and effectively. The auditors should be highly trained officials with permanent tenure in the Treasury Department, free of obligations to or motives of consideration for this or any subsequent administration, and authorized and empowered to examine into and make report upon the methods employed and the results obtained by the executive departments of the Government. Their reports should be made to the Congress and to the Secretary of the Treasury.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I trust that the Congress will give its immediate consideration to the problem of future taxation. Simplification of the income and profits taxes has become an immediate necessity. These taxes performed indispensable service during the <abbr expan="World War I">war</abbr>. They must, however, be simplified, not only to save the taxpayer inconvenience and expense, but in order that his liability may be made certain and definite.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">With reference to the details of the Revenue Law, the <personRef refurl="x4002290" reg="Carter Glass" link-pointer-type="person">Secretary of the Treasury</personRef> and the Commissioner of Internal Revenue will lay before you for your consideration certain amendments necessary or desirable in connection with the administration of the law—recommendations which have my approval and support. It is of the utmost importance that in dealing with this matter the present law should not be disturbed so far as regards taxes for the calendar year <date value="1920-99-99">1920</date>, payable in the calendar year <date value="1921-99-99">1921</date>. The Congress might well consider whether the higher rates of income and profits taxes can in peace times be effectively productive of revenue, and whether they may not, on the contrary, be destructive of business activity and productive of waste and inefficiency. There is a point at which in peace times high rates of income and profits taxes discourage energy, remove the incentive to new enterprise, encourage extravagant expenditures and produce industrial stagnation with consequent unemployment and other attendant evils.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The problem is not an easy one. A fundamental change has taken place with reference to the position of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> in the world’s affairs. The prejudice and passions engendered by decades of controversy between two schools of political and economic thought,—the one believers in protection of American industries, the other believers in tariff for revenue only,—must be subordinated to the single consideration of the public interest in the light of utterly changed conditions. Before the war <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> was heavily the debtor of the rest of the world and the interest payments she had to make to foreign countries on American securities held abroad, the expenditures of American travelers abroad and the ocean freight charges she had to pay to others, about balanced the value of her pre-war favorable balance of trade. During the war America’s exports have been greatly stimulated, and increased prices have increased their value. On the other hand, she has purchased a large proportion of the American securities previously held abroad, has loaned some <currency type="U.S.A">$9,000,000,000</currency> to foreign governments, and has built her own ships. Our favorable balance of trade has thus been greatly increased and <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Europe</place> has been deprived of the means of meeting it heretofore existing. <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Europe</place> can have only three ways of meeting the favorable balance of trade in peace times: by imports into this country of gold or of goods, or by establishing new credits. <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Europe</place> is in no position at the present time to ship gold to us nor could we contemplate large further imports of gold into this country without concern. The time has nearly passed for international governmental loans and it will take time to develop in this country a market for foreign securities. Anything, therefore, which would tend to prevent foreign countries from settling for our exports by shipments of goods into this country could only have the effect of preventing them from paying for our exports and therefore of preventing the exports from being made. The productivity of the country greatly stimulated by the war must find an outlet by exports to foreign countries and any measures taken to prevent imports will inevitably curtail exports, force curtailment of production, load the banking machinery of the country with credits to carry unsold products and produce industrial stagnation and unemployment. If we want to sell, we must be prepared to buy. Whatever, therefore, may have been our views during the period of growth of American business concerning tariff legislation, we must now adjust our own economic life to a changed condition growing out of the fact that American business is full grown and that <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> is the greatest capitalist in the world.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">No policy of isolation will satisfy the growing needs and opportunities of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place>. The provincial standards and policies of the past, which have held American business as if in a strait-jacket, must yield and give way to the needs and exigencies of the new day in which we live, a day full of hope and promise for American business, if we will but take advantage of the opportunities that are ours for the asking. The recent war has ended our isolation and thrown upon us a great duty and responsibility. The <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> must share the expanding world market. The <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> desires for itself only equal opportunity with the other nations of the world, and that through the process of friendly cooperation and fair competition the legitimate interests of the nations concerned may be successfully and equitably adjusted.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">There are other matters of importance upon which I urged action at the last session of Congress which are still pressing for solution. I am sure it is not necessary for me again to remind you that there is one immediate and very practicable question resulting from the war which we should meet in the most liberal spirit. It is a matter of recognition and relief to our soldiers. I can do no better than to quote from my last message urging this very action:</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">“We must see to it that our returning soldiers are assisted in every practicable way to find the places for which they are fitted in the daily work of the country. This can be done by developing and maintaining upon an adequate scale the admirable organization created by the Department of Labor for placing men seeking work; and it can also be done, in at least one very great field, by creating new opportunities for individual enterprise. The <personRef refurl="x4005191" reg="Franklin K. Lane" link-pointer-type="person">Secretary of the Interior</personRef> has pointed out the way by which returning soldiers may be helped to find and take up land in the hitherto undeveloped regions of the country which the Federal Government has already prepared or can readily prepare for cultivation and also on many of the cutover or neglected areas which lie within the limits of the older states; and I once more take the liberty of recommending very urgently that his plans shall receive the immediate and substantial support of the Congress.”</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">In the matter of tariff legislation, I beg to call your attention to the statements contained in my last message urging legislation with reference to the establishment of the chemical and dyestuffs industry in <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place>:</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">“Among the industries to which special consideration should be given is that of the manufacture of dyestuffs and related chemicals. Our complete dependence upon German supplies before the war made the interruption of trade a cause of exceptional economic disturbance. The close relation between the manufacture of dyestuffs, on the one hand, and of explosives and poisonous gases, on the other, moreover, has given the industry an exceptional significance and value. Although the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> will gladly and unhesitatingly join in the <word altform="program">programme</word> of international disarmament, it will, nevertheless, be a policy of obvious prudence to make certain of the successful maintenance of many strong and well-equipped chemical plants. The German chemical industry, with which we will be brought into competition, was and may well be again, a thoroughly knit monopoly capable of exercising a competition of a peculiarly insidious and dangerous kind.”</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">During the war the farmer performed a vital and willing service to the nation. By materially increasing the production of his land, he supplied <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> and the Allies with the increased amounts of food necessary to keep their immense armies in the field. He indispensably helped to win the war. But there is now scarcely less need of increasing the production in food and the necessaries of life. I ask the Congress to consider means of encouraging effort along these lines. The importance of doing everything possible to promote production along economical lines, to improve marketing, and to make rural life more attractive and healthful, is obvious. I would urge approval of the plans already proposed to the Congress by the <personRef reg="David F. Houston" link-pointer-type="person">Secretary of Agriculture</personRef>, to secure the essential facts required for the proper study of this question, through the proposed enlarged <word altform="programs">programmes</word> for farm management studies and crop estimates. I would urge, also, the continuance of federal participation in the building of good roads, under the terms of existing law and under the direction of present agencies; the need of further action on the part of the States and the Federal Government to preserve and develop our forest resources, especially through the practice of better forestry methods on private holdings and the extension of the publicly owned forests; better support for country schools and the more definite direction of their courses of study along lines related to rural problems; and fuller provision for sanitation in rural districts and the building up of needed hospital and medical facilities in these localities. Perhaps the way might be cleared for many of these desirable reforms by a fresh, comprehensive survey made of rural conditions by a conference composed of representatives of the farmers and of the agricultural agencies responsible for leadership.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I would call your attention to the widespread condition of political restlessness in our body politic. The causes of this unrest, while various and complicated, are superficial rather than deep seated. Broadly, they arise from or are connected with the failure on the part of our Government to arrive speedily at a just and permanent peace permitting return to normal conditions, from the transfusion of radical theories from seething European centers pending such delay, from heartless profiteering resulting in the increase of the cost of living, and lastly from the machinations of passionate and malevolent agitators. With the return to normal conditions, this unrest will rapidly disappear. In the meantime, it does much evil. It seems to me that in dealing with this situation Congress should not be impatient or drastic but should seek rather to remove the causes. It should endeavor to bring our country back speedily to a peace basis, with ameliorated living conditions under the minimum of restrictions upon personal liberty that is consistent with our reconstruction problems. And it should arm the Federal Government with power to deal in its criminal courts with those persons who by violent methods would abrogate our time-tested institutions. With the free expression of opinion and with the advocacy of orderly political change, however fundamental, there must be no interference, but towards passion and malevolence tending to incite crime and insurrection under guise of political evolution there should be no leniency. Legislation to this end has been recommended by the Attorney General and should be enacted. In this direct connection, I would call your attention to my recommendations on August 8th, pointing out legislative measures which would be effective in controlling and bringing down the present cost of living, which contributes so largely to this unrest. On only one of these recommendations has the Congress acted. If the Government’s campaign is to be effective, it is necessary that the other steps suggested should be acted on at once.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I renew and strongly urge the necessity of the extension of the present Food Control Act as to the period of time in which it shall remain in operation. The Attorney General has submitted a bill providing for an extension of this Act for a period of six months. As it now stands it is limited in operation to the period of the war and becomes inoperative upon the formal proclamation of peace. It is imperative that it should be extended at once. The Department of Justice has built up extensive machinery for the purpose of enforcing its provisions; all of which must be abandoned upon the conclusion of peace unless the provisions of this Act are extended.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">During this period the Congress will have an opportunity to make similar, permanent provisions and regulations with regard to all goods destined for interstate commerce and to exclude them from interstate shipment, if the requirements of the law are not complied with. Some such regulation is imperatively necessary. The abuses that have grown up in the manipulation of prices by the withholding of foodstuffs and other necessaries of life cannot otherwise be effectively prevented. There can be no doubt of either the necessity or the legitimacy of such measures.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">As I pointed out in my last message, publicity can accomplish a great deal in this campaign. The aims of the Government must be clearly brought to the attention of the consuming public, civic organizations and state officials, who are in a position to lend their assistance to our efforts. You have made available funds with which to carry on this campaign, but there is no provision in the law authorizing their expenditure for the purpose of making the public fully informed about the efforts of the Government. Specific recommendation has been made by the Attorney General in this regard. I would strongly urge upon you its immediate adoption, as it constitutes one of the preliminary steps to this campaign.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I also renew my recommendation that the Congress pass a law regulating cold storage as it is regulated, for example, by the laws of the State of New Jersey, which limit the time during which goods may be kept in storage, prescribe the method of disposing of them if kept beyond the permitted period, and require that goods released from storage shall in all cases bear the date of their receipt. It would materially add to the serviceability of the law, for the purpose we now have in view, if it were also prescribed that all goods released from storage for interstate shipment should have plainly marked upon each package the selling or market price at which they went into storage. By this means the purchaser would always be able to learn what profits stood between him and the producer or the wholesale dealer.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I would also renew my recommendation that all goods destined for interstate commerce should in every case, where their form or package makes it possible, be plainly marked with the price at which they left the hands of the producer.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">We should formulate a law requiring a federal license of all corporations engaged in interstate commerce and embodying in the license, or in the conditions under which it is to be issued, specific regulations designed to secure competitive selling and prevent unconscionable profits in the method of marketing. Such a law would afford a welcome opportunity to effect other much needed reforms in the business of interstate shipment and in the methods of corporations which are engaged in it; but for the moment I confine my recommendations to the object immediately in hand, which is to lower the cost of living.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">No one who has observed the march of events in the last year can fail to note the absolute need of a definite <word altform="program">programme</word> to bring about an improvement in the conditions of labor. There can be no settled conditions leading to increased production and a reduction in the cost of living if labor and capital are to be antagonists instead of partners. Sound thinking and an honest desire to serve the interests of the whole nation, as distinguished from the interests of a class, must be applied to the solution of this great and pressing problem. The failure of other nations to consider this matter in a vigorous way has produced bitterness and jealousies and antagonisms, the food of radicalism. The only way to keep men from agitating against grievances is to remove the grievances. An unwillingness even to discuss these matters produces only dissatisfaction and gives comfort to the extreme elements in our country which endeavor to stir up disturbances in order to provoke governments to embark upon a course of retaliation and repression. The seed of revolution is repression. The remedy for these things must not be negative in character. It must be constructive. It must comprehend the general interest. The real antidote for the unrest which manifests itself is not suppression, but a deep consideration of the wrongs that beset our national life and the application of a remedy.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Congress has already shown its willingness to deal with these industrial wrongs by establishing the eight-hour day as the standard in every field of labor. It has sought to find a way to prevent child labor. It has served the whole country by leading the way in developing the means of preserving and safeguarding lives and health in dangerous industries. It must now help in the difficult task of finding a method that will bring about a genuine democratization of industry, based upon the full recognition of the right of those who work, in whatever rank, to participate in some organic way in every decision which directly affects their welfare. It is with this purpose in mind that I called a conference to meet in Washington on <date value="1919-12-01">December 1st</date>, to consider these problems in all their broad aspects, with the idea of bringing about a better understanding between these two interests.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The great unrest throughout the world, out of which has emerged a demand for an immediate consideration of the difficulties between capital and labor, bids us put our own house in order. Frankly, there can be no permanent and lasting settlements between capital and labor which do not recognize the fundamental concepts for which labor has been struggling through the years. The whole world gave its recognition and endorsement to these fundamental purposes in the League of Nations. The statesmen gathered at Versailles recognized the fact that world stability could not be had by reverting to industrial standards and conditions against which the average workman of the world had revolted. It is, therefore, the task of the statesmen of this new day of change and readjustment to recognize world conditions and to seek to bring about, through legislation, conditions that will mean the ending of age-long antagonisms between capital and labor and that will hopefully lead to the building up of a comradeship which will result not only in greater contentment among the mass of workmen but also bring about a greater production and a greater prosperity to business itself.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">To analyze the particulars in the demands of labor is to admit the justice of their complaint in many matters that lie at their basis. The workman demands an adequate wage, sufficient to permit him to live in comfort, unhampered by the fear of poverty and want in his old age. He demands the right to live and the right to work amidst sanitary surroundings, both in home and in workshop, surroundings that develop and do not retard his own health and well-being; and the right to provide for his children’s wants in the matter of health and education. In other words, it is his desire to make the conditions of his life and the lives of those dear to him tolerable and easy to bear.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The establishment of the principles regarding labor laid down in the covenant of the League of Nations offers us the way to industrial peace and conciliation. No other road lies open to us. Not to pursue this one is longer to invite enmities, bitterness, and antagonisms which in the end only lead to industrial and social disaster. The unwilling workman is not a profitable servant. An employee whose industrial life is hedged about by hard and unjust conditions, which he did not create and over which he has no control, lacks that fine spirit of enthusiasm and volunteer effort which are the necessary ingredients of a great producing entity. Let us be frank about this solemn matter. The evidences of world-wide unrest which manifest themselves in violence throughout the world bid us pause and consider the means to be found to stop the spread of this contagious thing before it saps the very vitality of the nation itself. Do we gain strength by withholding the remedy? Or is it not the business of statesmen to treat these manifestations of unrest which meet us on every hand as evidences of an economic disorder and to apply constructive remedies wherever necessary, being sure that in the application of the remedy we touch not the vital tissues of our industrial and economic life? There can be no recession of the tide of unrest until constructive instrumentalities are set up to stem that tide.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Governments must recognize the right of men collectively to bargain for humane objects that have at their base the mutual protection and welfare of those engaged in all industries. Labor must not be longer treated as a commodity. It must be regarded as the activity of human beings, possessed of deep yearnings and desires. The business man gives his best thought to the repair and replenishment of his machinery, so that its usefulness will not be impaired and its power to produce may always be at its height and kept in full vigor and motion. No less regard ought to be paid to the human machine, which after all propels the machinery of the world and is the great dynamic force that lies back of all industry and progress. Return to the old standards of wage and industry in employment are unthinkable. The terrible tragedy of war which has just ended and which has brought the world to the verge of chaos and disaster would be in vain if there should ensue a return to the conditions of the past. Europe itself, whence has come the unrest which now holds the world at bay, is an example of standpatism in these vital human matters which America might well accept as an example, not to be followed but studiously to be avoided. <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Europe</place> made labor the differential, and the price of it all is enmity and antagonism and prostrated industry. The right of labor to live in peace and comfort must be recognized by governments and <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> should be the first to lay the foundation stones upon which industrial peace shall be built.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Labor not only is entitled to an adequate wage, but capital should receive a reasonable return upon its investment and is entitled to protection at the hands of the government in every emergency. No government worthy of the name can “play” these elements against each other, for there is a mutuality of interest between them which the government must seek to express and to safeguard at all cost.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The right of individuals to strike is inviolate and ought not to be interfered with by any process of government, but there is a predominant right and that is the right of the government to protect all of its people and to assert its power and majesty against the challenge of any class. The government, when it asserts that right, seeks not to antagonize a class but simply to defend the right of the whole people as against the irreparable harm and injury that might be done by the attempt by any class to usurp a power that only government itself has a right to exercise as a protection to all.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">In the matter of international disputes which have led to war, statesmen have sought to set up as a remedy arbitration for war. Does this not point the way for the settlement of industrial disputes, by the establishment of a tribunal, fair and just alike to all, which will settle industrial disputes which in the past have led to war and disaster? <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place>, witnessing the evil consequences which have followed out of such disputes between these contending forces, must not admit itself impotent to deal with these matters by means of peaceful processes. Surely, there must be some method of bringing together in a council of peace and amity these two great interests, out of which will come a happier day of peace and cooperation, a day that will make men more hopeful and enthusiastic in their various tasks, that will make for more comfort and happiness in living and a more tolerable condition among all classes of men. Certainly human intelligence can devise some acceptable tribunal for adjusting the differences between capital and labor.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">This is the hour of test and trial for <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place>. By her prowess and strength, and the indomitable courage of her soldiers, she demonstrated her power to vindicate on foreign battlefields her conceptions of liberty and justice. Let not her influence as a mediator between capital and labor be weakened and her own failure to settle matters of purely domestic concern be proclaimed to the world. There are those in this country who threaten direct action to force their will upon a majority. <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Russia</place> today, with its blood and terror, is a painful object lesson of the power of minorities. It makes little difference what minority it is; whether capital or labor, or any other class; no sort of privilege will ever be permitted to dominate this country. We are a partnership or nothing that is worth while. We are a democracy, where the majority are the masters, or all the hopes and purposes of the men who founded this government have been defeated and forgotten. In America there is but one way by which great reforms can be accomplished and the relief sought by classes obtained, and that is through the orderly processes of representative government. Those who would propose any other method of reform are enemies of this country. <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> will not be daunted by threats nor lose her composure or calmness in these distressing times. We can afford, in the midst of this day of passion and unrest, to be self-contained and sure. The instrument of all reform in America is the ballot. The road to economic and social reform in America is the straight road of justice to all classes and conditions of men. Men have but to follow this road to realize the full fruition of their objects and purposes. Let those beware who would take the shorter road of disorder and revolution. The right road is the road of justice and orderly process.</p>

         <p rend="noindent" xml:space="preserve"><render as="smallcap" rend="inherit">Gentlemen of the Congress</render>:</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">When I addressed myself to performing the duty laid upon the President by the Constitution to present to you an annual report on the state of the Union, I found my thought dominated by an immortal sentence of <person refurl="x4000471" reg="Abraham Lincoln" link-pointer-type="person">Abraham Lincoln’s</person>,</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">“Let us have faith that right makes might, and in that faith let us dare to do our duty as we understand it,”</p>
         <p rend="noindent" xml:space="preserve">—a sentence immortal because it embodies in a form of utter simplicity and purity the essential faith of the nation, the faith in which it was conceived and the faith in which it has grown to glory and power. With that faith and the birth of a nation founded upon it came the hope into the world that a new order would prevail throughout the affairs of mankind, an order in which reason and right would take precedence of covetousness and force, and I believe that I express the wish and purpose of every thoughtful American when I say that this sentence marks for us in the plainest manner the part we should play alike in the arrangement of our domestic affairs and in our exercise of influence upon the affairs of the world. By this faith, and by this faith alone, can the world be lifted out of its present confusion and despair. It was this faith which prevailed over the wicked force of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Germany</place>. You will remember that the beginning of the end of the <abbr expan="World War I">war</abbr> came when the German people found themselves face to face with the conscience of the world and realized that right was everywhere arrayed against the wrong that their government was attempting to perpetrate. I think, therefore, that it is true to say that this was the faith which won the war. Certainly this is the faith with which our gallant men went into the field and out upon the seas to make sure of victory.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">This is the mission upon which democracy came into the world. Democracy is an assertion of the right of the individual to live and to be treated justly as against any attempt on the part of any combination of individuals to make laws which will overburden him or which will destroy his equality among his fellows in the matter of right or privilege, and I think we all realize that the day has come when democracy is being put upon its final test. The old world is just now suffering from a wanton rejection of the principle of democracy and a substitution of the principle of autocracy as asserted in the name but without the authority and sanction of the multitude. This is the time of all others when democracy should prove its purity and its spiritual power to prevail. It is surely the manifest destiny of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> to lead in the attempt to make this spirit prevail.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">There are two ways in which the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> can assist to accomplish this great object: First, by offering the example within her own borders of the will and power of democracy to make and enforce laws which are unquestionably just and which are equal in their administration,—laws which secure its full right to labor and yet at the same time safeguard the integrity of property, and particularly of that property which is devoted to the development of industry and the increase of the necessary wealth of the world. Second, by standing for right and justice as towards individual nations. The law of democracy is for the protection of the weak, and the influence of every democracy in the world should be for the protection of the weak nation, the nation which is struggling towards its right and towards its proper recognition and privilege in the family of nations. The <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> cannot refuse this rôle of champion without putting the stigma of rejection upon the great and devoted men who brought its government into existence and established it in the face of almost universal opposition and intrigue, even in the face of wanton force, as, for example, against the Orders in Council of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Great Britain</place> and the arbitrary Napoleonic Decrees which involved us in what we know as the War of <date value="1812-99-99">1812</date>. I urge you to consider that the display of an immediate disposition on the part of the Congress to remedy any injustices or evils that may have shown themselves in our own national life will afford the most effectual offset to the forces of chaos and tyranny which are playing so disastrous a part in the fortunes of the free peoples of more than one part of the world. The <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> is of necessity the sample democracy of the world, and the triumph of democracy depends upon its success.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Recovery from the disturbing and sometimes disastrous effects of the late war has been exceedingly slow on the other side of the water and has given promise, I venture to say, of early completion only in our own fortunate country; but even with us the recovery halts and is impeded at times and there are immediately serviceable acts of legislation which it seems to me we ought to attempt, to assist that recovery and prove the indestructible recuperative force of a great government of the people. One of these is to prove that a great democracy can keep house as successfully and in as businesslike a fashion as any other government. It seems to me that the first step towards proving this is to supply ourselves with a systematic method of handling our estimates and expenditures and bringing them to the point where they will not be an unnecessary strain upon our income or necessitate unreasonable taxation, in other words, a workable budget system, and I respectfully suggest that two elements are essential to such a system; namely, not only that the proposal of appropriations should be in the hands of a single body, such as a single appropriations committee in each house of the Congress, but also that this body should be brought into such cooperation with the departments of the Government and with the Treasury of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> as would enable it to act upon a complete conspectus of the needs of the Government and the resources from which it must draw its income. I reluctantly vetoed the Budget Bill passed by the last session of the Congress because of a Constitutional objection. The house of Representatives subsequently modified the Bill in order to meet this objection. In the revised form I believe that the Bill, coupled with action already taken by the Congress to revise its rules and procedure, furnishes the foundations for an effective national budget system. I earnestly hope, therefore, that one of the first steps taken by the present session of the Congress will be to pass the Budget Bill.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The nation’s finances have shown marked improvement during the past year. The total ordinary receipts of <currency type="U.S.A">$6,694,000,000</currency> for the fiscal year <date value="1920-99-99">1920</date> exceeded those for <date value="1919-99-99">1919</date> by <currency type="U.S.A">$1,542,000,000</currency>, while the total net ordinary expenditures decreased from <currency type="U.S.A">$18,514,000,000</currency> to <currency type="U.S.A">$6,403,000,000</currency>. The gross public debt, which reached its highest point on <date value="1919-08-31">31 August, 1919</date>, when it was <currency type="U.S.A">$26,596,000,000</currency>, had dropped on <date value="1920-11-30">30 November, 1920</date>, to <currency type="U.S.A">$24,175,000,000</currency>. There has also been a marked decrease in holdings of government war securities by the banking institutions of the country, as well as in the amount of bills held by the Federal Reserve Banks secured by government war obligations. This fortunate result has relieved the banks and left them freer to finance the needs of agriculture, industry and commerce. It has been due in large part to the reduction of the public debt, especially of the floating debt, but more particularly to the improved distribution of government securities among permanent investors. The cessation of the Government’s borrowings except through short-term certificates of indebtedness has been a matter of great consequence to the people of the country at large, as well as to the holders of Liberty bonds and Victory notes, and has had an important bearing on the matter of effective credit control. The year has been characterized by the progressive withdrawal of the Treasury from the domestic credit market and from a position of dominant influence in that market. The future course will necessarily depend upon the extent to which economies are practiced and upon the burdens placed upon the Treasury, as well as upon industrial developments and the maintenance of tax receipts at a sufficiently high level.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">The fundamental fact which at present dominates the Government’s financial situation is that seven and a half billions of its war indebtedness mature within the next two and a half years. Of this amount, two and a half billions are floating debt and five billions Victory notes and War Savings certificates. The fiscal programme of the Government must be determined with reference to these maturities. Sound policy demands that government expenditures be reduced to the lowest amount which will permit the various services to operate efficiently and that government receipts from taxes and salvage be maintained sufficiently high to provide for current requirements, including interest and sinking fund charges on the public debt, and at the same time retire the floating debt and part of the Victory Loan before maturity. With rigid economy, vigorious salvage operations and adequate revenues from taxation, a surplus of current receipts over current expenditures can be realized and should be applied to the floating debt. All branches of the Government should cooperate to see that this programme is realized.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I cannot overemphasize the necessity of economy in government appropriations and expenditures and the avoidance by the Congress of practices which take money from the Treasury by indefinite or revolving fund appropriations. The estimates for the present year show that over a billion dollars of expenditures were authorized by the last Congress in addition to the amounts shown in the usual compiled statements of appropriations. This strikingly illustrates the importance of making direct and specific appropriations. The relation between the current receipts and current expenditures of the Government during the present fiscal year, as well as during the last half of the last fiscal year, has been disturbed by the extraordinary burdens thrown upon the Treasury by the Transportation Act, in connection with the return of the railroads to private control. Over <currency type="U.S.A">$600,000,000</currency> has already been paid to the railroads under this Act,—<currency type="U.S.A">$350,000,000</currency> during the present fiscal year; and it is estimated that further payments aggregating possibly <currency type="U.S.A">$650,000,000</currency> must still be made to the railroads during the current year. It is obvious that these large payments have already seriously limited the Government’s progress in retiring the floating debt.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Closely connected with this, it seems to me, is the necessity for an immediate consideration of the revision of our tax laws. Simplification of the income and profits taxes has become an immediate necessity. These taxes performed an indispensable service during the war. The need for their simplification, however, is very great, in order to save the taxpayer inconvenience and expense and in order to make his liability more certain and definite. Other and more detailed recommendations with regard to taxes will no doubt be laid before you by the <personRef reg="David F. Houston" link-pointer-type="person">Secretary of the Treasury</personRef> and the Commissioner of Internal Revenue.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">It is my privilege to draw to the attention of Congress for very sympathetic consideration the problem of providing adequate facilities for the care and treatment of former members of the military and naval forces who are sick or disabled as the result of their participation in the war. These heroic men can never be paid in money for the service they patriotically rendered the nation. Their reward will lie rather in realization of the fact that they vindicated the rights of their country and aided in safeguarding civilization. The nation’s gratitude must be effectively revealed to them by the most ample provision for their medical care and treatment as well as for their vocational training and placement. The time has come when a more complete programme can be formulated and more satisfactorily administered for their treatment and training, and I earnestly urge that the Congress give the matter its early consideration. The Secretary of the Treasury and the Board for Vocational Education will outline in their annual reports proposals covering medical care and rehabilitation which I am sure will engage your earnest study and command your most generous support.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Permit me to emphasize once more the need for action upon certain matters upon whích I dwelt at some length in my message to the Second Session of the Sixty-sixth Congress: the necessity, for example, of encouraging the manufacture of dyestuffs and related chemicals; the importance of doing everything possible to promote agricultural production along economic lines, to improve agricultural marketing and to make rural life more attractive and healthful; the need for a law regulating cold storage in such a way as to limit the time during which goods may be kept in storage, prescribing the method of disposing of them if kept beyond the permitted period, and requiring goods released from storage in all cases to bear the date of their receipt. It would also be most serviceable if it were provided that all goods released from cold storage for interstate shipment should have plainly marked upon each package the selling or market price at which they went into storage, in order that the purchaser might be able to learn what profits stood between him and the producer or the wholesale dealer. Indeed, it would be very serviceable to the public if all goods destined for interstate commerce were made to carry upon every packing case whose form made it possible a plain statement of the price at which they left the hands of the producer. I respectfully call your attention, also, to the recommendations of the message referred to with regard to a federal license for all corporations engaged in interstate commerce.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">In brief, the immediate legislative need of the time is the removal of all obstacles to the realization of the best ambitions of our people in their several classes of employment and the strengthening of all instrumentalities by which difficulties are to be met and removed and justice dealt out, whether by law or by some form of mediation and conciliation. I do not feel it to be my privilege at present to suggest the detailed and particular methods by which these objects may be attained, but I have faith that the inquiries of your several committees will discover the way and the method.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">In response to what I believe to be the impulse of sympathy and opinion throughout the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place>, I earnestly suggest that the Congress authorize the Treasury of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place> to make to the struggling Government of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Armenia</place> such a loan as was made to several of the Allied Governments during the war; and I would also suggest that it would be desirable to provide in the legislation itself that the expenditure of the money thus loaned should be under the supervision of a commission, or at least a commissioner, from the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">United States</place>, in order that revolutionary tendencies within Armenia itself might not be afforded by the loan a further tempting opportunity.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">Allow me to call your attention to the fact that the people of the <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">Philippine Islands</place> have succeeded in maintaining a stable government since the last action of the Congress in their behalf, and have thus fulfilled the condition set by the Congress as precedent to a consideration of granting independence to the Islands. I respectfully submit that this condition precedent having been fulfilled, it is now our liberty and our duty to keep our promise to the people of those Islands by granting them the independence which they so honorably covet.</p>
         <p rend="indent" xml:space="preserve">I have not so much laid before you a series of recommendations, gentlemen, as sought to utter a confession of faith, of the faith in which I was bred and which it is my solemn purpose to stand by until my last fighting day. I believe this to be the faith of <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place>, the faith of the future, and of all the victories which await national action in the days to come, whether in <place rend="inherit" link-pointer-type="place">America</place> or elsewhere.</p>
